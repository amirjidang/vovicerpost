The singer is being accused of owing nearly $3 million in unpaid taxes, which she’s denying. Now, she’s filed a petition to dispute the claim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=#>court documents obtained by PEOPLE</a>, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says Beyonce owes $2.69 million in back taxes from the yeas 2018 and 2019. Specifically, it’s being said that she owes $805,850 from 2018 as well as $1,442,747 from 2019. Moreover, the IRS claims she owes more than $449,000 in penalties over the unpaid taxes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Adidas Sued By Investors For Ignoring Concerns Over Kanye West’s Behavior</a></span></p><p>Shortly after the news broke, Beyonce’s lawyer Michael C. Cohen released a statement saying they hope to clear the matter up soon. "We are working with the IRS and anticipate that the matter will be resolved shortly,” he said.</p><p>Moreover, Beyonce’s team is saying that at least $868,766 of the money in dispute was donated to charity in 2018, and therefore qualifies as a tax deduction. The charity to which she supposedly donated has not been named.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A court date hasn’t been set, and there’s a chance the matter could be settled beforehand.</p><p>Beyonce is <a href=#>hardly the first celebrity to run into tax troubles</a> with the IRS. In 2021, it was reported that Hole singer Courtney Love had a tax lien of $2.4 million. Her representative released a statement saying the issue wasn’t her fault.</p><p>"Through no deliberate fault of her own, Ms. Love had a tax issue that has since been resolved,” they said.</p><p>Similarly, Lindsay Lohan has been behind on hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes throughout the years, including in 2009 when she almost failed to pay the IRS $100,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Charlie Sheen lent Lindsay the money to pay off the debt, only for him to run into tax troubles years later. In 2019, it was reported the former Two and a Half Men star owed over $5.7 million to the IRS. However, <a href=#>Charlie later sued the IRS in 2021</a> over the debt.</p><p>Beyonce may be fighting with the IRS over nearly $3 million, but this pales in comparison to the pop star’s reported net worth. She reportedly has $500 million to her name, while her husband <a href=#>Jay-Z has a net worth of $2.5 million.</a></p><p>Not only does Beyonce have the money to pay back the IRS, but even more, she has the money to fight them in court.
