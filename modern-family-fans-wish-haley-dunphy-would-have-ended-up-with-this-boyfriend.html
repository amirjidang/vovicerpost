On top of amassing a huge fan following, the show also earned a list of accolades so long that any attempt to list all of the awards it won here would be foolhardy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a lot of ways a show that broke the mold, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Family could be controversial</a> for a lot of different reasons. For instance, to the show’s credit, its main characters were part of a large and loving family that was unlike any seen on mainstream TV in the past.</p><p>A perfect example of how Modern Family did things a little bit differently, the show managed to make Haley Dunphy’s love life surprising. Whereas most sitcoms seem to care most about a few will they or won’t they relationships, throughout most of Modern Family’s run Haley’s love life evolved in a much more organic way. However, just because the show’s writers kept things interesting for anyone that wanted Haley to find her happily ever after, doesn’t mean most viewers love how things worked out. After all, many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Family fans paid a lot of attention to every little detail of the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Photos Of Ariel Winter And Sarah Hyland Showing Their True Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=the-other-options>The Other Options</h2><p>At the end of the day, Modern Family fans clearly care most about two of Haley Dunphy’s relationships. Of course, given the fact that the show ran for an impressive 11 seasons, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Haley had several suitors</a>. In fact, Haley was even briefly involved with someone named Vincent, an ex-con who never even appeared on camera.</p><p>When it comes to the least memorable of Haley Dunphy’s love interests that appeared on camera, there is Ethan, the guy she spends time with at Disneyland. Then there is Andy, the bad boy from season 5, Chase, the character Robbie Amell portrayed for a season 6 episode, and Kenny, a sleazeball that Jason Mantzoukas plays to perfection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Haley’s lesser relationships that seemed to have some potential, Will from season 6 came across like a great guy but he didn’t stick around for long. For anyone who likes a traditional TV odd couple, there was Dr. Arvin Fennerman, Alex’s professor who helped Haley to grow as a person even though he hid their relationship from his mom. Finally, there was Rainer Shine, the TV weatherman who briefly was engaged to Haley before they both realized that was a mistake in a matter of minutes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Family Easter Eggs You Need To Watch Out For</a></span></p><h2 id=the-man-haley-built-a-family-with>The Man Haley Built A Family With</h2><p>First introduced in Modern Family’s pilot episode, when Dylan Marshall broke out into song in front of Haley’s family it seemed like he wouldn’t stick around for long. Written out of the show seemingly permanently after Haley turned down his proposal, at that time Dylan opted to live and work on a ranch.</p><p>Brought back again and again in the seasons that followed, even when it seemed like the show had completely moved on, Dylan was bound to pop up out of nowhere. During each one of these subsequent appearances, it almost always was clear that he cared deeply about Haley and she felt the same way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Always stuck in Haley’s orbit even when he married another woman, Dylan wound up being the man who won her heart in the end. Married as of season 10, Haley went on to have Dylan’s children, a pair of twins named Poppy and George. Sadly, many fans and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Hyland herself weren't happy with how things ended for Haley</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Winter Wasn’t Too Thrilled About A Certain Modern Family Scene</a></span></p><h2 id=the-right-choice>The Right Choice?</h2><p>First introduced to Modern Family fans as Jay and Gloria’s nanny, fans quickly became aware of the fact that Andy Bailey would interact with Haley more than any other character. An all-around good guy, Andy had loads of chemistry with Haley from the start but there was one problem, he had a long-time girlfriend at the time. Eventually able to overcome that massive obstacle, Andy and Haley were an adorable couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, even though it seemed like Andy was a great guy for Haley, their relationship was all too brief. An interesting choice for the writers, considering how long it took for the couple to get together in the first place, many viewers were disappointed they didn’t last.</p><p>After Haley let Andy go so he could capture his dream job, it was one of the most heartbreaking moments in the show’s history. However, many viewers remained convinced that they would find their ways back to one another. After all, it could be argued that Andy was the first guy to see past Haley’s exterior and her wild persona, to the person she was on the inside. On top of that, Haley accepted Andy for the person he truly was and she even said he was “the first man (she) really loved”. For those reasons and a lot of other ones, many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Family fans wanted Haley to wind up with Andy</a> and they still do to this day.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Family: 10 Things The Cast Members Have Said About Working On The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqJyVp7tussCmoKWxXZuur7%2BMsKCsoF2drq2x2GabrqagncZuw86uo51lmJbDpnnEp5uenF2qvW7DyK2fZqyYnsBurs6ynauhlaOxcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./molly-shannon-claims-late-gary-coleman-sexually-harassed-her.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Molly Shannon Claims Late Gary Coleman Sexually Harassed Her</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./misa-koprova-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Misa Koprova Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
