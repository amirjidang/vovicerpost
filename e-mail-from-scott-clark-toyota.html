Because this recall speaks directly to the safety of some Toyota vehicles, it has caused concern among many of our customers. We deeply and sincerely regret the concern this has caused. We now are receiving the parts necessary to perform this fix, and soon you will be contacted directly from Toyota by mail indicating when to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, with this letter, I hope to bring important information to light. I urge you to patiently read through this entire document. I am convinced that you will be greatly informed and hopefully greatly relieved along the way.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Before going further, I would like to point out the obvious, many of the 178 employees of Scott Clark Toyota drive to work daily in Toyotas affected by the recent recall, and still many more have various family members and dear friends that are also driving Toyotas affected by this recall, what's more, I myself have my wife driving our little ones in a vehicle affected by this recall. It is not an exaggeration to say that as a whole we have been deeply and profoundly affected by this recall, for our concern is not just limited to issues relating to customer safety, but to the safety of our friends, families, and, in many cases, even our own personal safety.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">What follows is a short list of the important facts relating to this recall:</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">· Reported incidents have been exceptionally rare.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">In fact, in the last 4 years Scott Clark Toyota has sold nearly 40,000 total vehicles between retail and fleet sales have yet to confirm a single reported incident. Toyota makes it clear that this situation is rare, and generally does not occur suddenly; and in the rare instances when it does occur, the vehicle can be controlled with firm and steady application of the brakes (see below for a list of safety procedures).</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">· Toyota is acting in an unprecedented fashion in order to put safety first.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The size, scope, and speed of this recall effort by Toyota is unprecedented. Unfortunately many customers have mistaken the colossal scale and urgency of this effort to imply an immediate and certain risk. That is simply not the case. Toyota's response is out of an abundance of concern and caution. Nothing is more important to Toyota than the safety and reliability of the vehicles we drive every day.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">· Toyota identified the necessary remedy, and starting today, parts are arriving in order to rapidly repair customer cars.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Toyota engineers have developed and rigorously tested a solution that is both effective and simple.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Scott Clark Toyota deeply regrets this matter and we apologize for all the concern and inconvenience associated with it. Soon Toyota will begin mailing owners with instructions on when to bring your vehicle in for the modifications. In order to partially offset your inconvenience and put your safety first, we plan to present every customer involved in the recall with the following: · $10 gas card · $25 gift certificate good towards the purchase of any service or parts purchase · $500 gift certificate good towards the purchase of any new or pre-owned vehicle · Free comprehensive vehicle safety inspection</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Additionally, we are convinced that we are uniquely positioned to best assist you. We offer: · Extended service hours, including open to Midnight and Sunday hours, in order to best accommodate our customers · The 2nd largest Toyota Service Department in the Southeast · 74 individual service bays staffed by Factory trained Technicians · Available shuttle service · An expansive, accommodating customer lounge featuring multiple large televisions · A children's play area · A quiet room complete with a cozy fireplace · Wi-Fi throughout · A complimentary café with refreshments, soft drinks, and coffee · Manicures will be provided Monday -Friday · A service team unmatched in overall experience and customer service, led by Roger Belk, Service Director, 33 years with Scott Clark Toyota, and Larry Baker, Parts Director, 38 years with Scott Clark Toyota</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">For decades many of you have trusted Scott Clark Toyota to take care of you. You made us the number 18 Toyota dealer in the nation for overall sales in 2009, and only because of you, we won Toyota's most prestigious awards for Sales and Customer Satisfaction, the Board of Governors Award and the President's Award.
