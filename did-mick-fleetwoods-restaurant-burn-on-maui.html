Over the years, Fleetwood's has welcomed countless guests, and since the restaurant opened in 2012, Mick is often spotted there, too.</p><p>Commenters on social media often shared stories, on either Mick's posts or those of the restaurant, to say how great the ambiance was and thank Mick for his hospitality. The restaurant was well-known for its delicious dishes, as well as being something of a hotspot in Lahaina.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Fleetwood Mac Song Made The Band The Most Money?

That day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mick posted on his official Instagram account</a> that "Fleetwoods on front Street has been lost and while we are heartbroken our main priority is the safety of our dear staff and team members."</p><p>Giving "heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the people of MAUI," Mick noted that the "devastating" moment was impacting people all over the island, calling other losses "unimaginable."</p><p>Commenters flocked to Mick's post to talk about their fond memories at the restaurant and give prayers to the people of Maui.</p><p>For Mick, the loss was particularly personal, as he has lived in Maui for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-mick-fleetwood-move-to-hawaii>When Did Mick Fleetwood Move To Hawaii?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mick-fleetwood-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>As Mick wrote in his Instagram post noting the loss of his restaurant, "MAUI and The Lahaina community have been my home for several decades." In one interview in which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he spoke about his restaurant and coffee businesses</a>, Mick chatted about his roots in Hawaii.</p><p>His close friend, who helped launch a coffee blend with Mick later, moved to Maui in 1991. When Mick began frequenting the island (and taking his famed photographs), he met Gerard Marti, who owned a gallery.</p><p>Gerard 'inspired' Mick to showcase his work, which led to his photography being shown not just in Maui, but in other places, too. The two later collaborated on Mick's coffee line, years after they had already become "dear friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Lindsey Buckingham Use A Fleetwood Mac Song To Get Back At Stevie Nicks After Their Break Up?</a></span></p><p>At the time of the interview, Mick explained that he lived in Hawaii but had, of course, toured around the world with his band. That exposure to different places in the world helped inspire his coffee line; Mick spent time in Ghana and Kenya to choose his coffee beans and blends.</p><p>Mick also hinted that he owned more than one restaurant in Hawaii, although Fleetwood's on Front St. was obviously the most well-known. In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mick gave an interview where he talked about plans to open a gallery and retail spot</a> called Mick's House of Fleetwood in Paia.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House of Fleetwood in Lahaina</a> apparently opened in 2014, and its address is in Lahaina, whereas the 2021-discussed store would be at the "entrance to Paia."
