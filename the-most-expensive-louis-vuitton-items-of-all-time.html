Its products include leather goods and luxury trunks, watches, jewelries and accessories, shoes and sunglasses. These products all bear the brand’s famous LV monogram, and are sold through their boutique shops, high-end department stores and through their website. It is generally considered as the most valuable luxury brand in the world valued at more than $25 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The brand, however, is also one of the most counterfeited in the world. Experts estimate that up to 18 percent of all counterfeit products in the European Union are knock offs of Louis Vuitton. And to think that the famous monogram canvas was created to prevent the counterfeiting of its products.</p><p>Just how popular is the Louis Vuitton brand? A condom that had the Louis Vuitton monogram, but which did not exactly have the company’s blessing, was being sold for $68 each. Irakli Kiziria of Georgia, the former Soviet republic, created it. No, the condom does not does not do anything special to make you unforgettable to the woman. But because it had the famous monogram of LV, the price automatically shot up from its normal $2 for three pieces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The company considers counterfeiting as a serious issue and does not take it sitting down. It has limited the distribution network for its products to upscale stores and specialty boutique shops. This is a far cry from the 80s when Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue were widely selling Louis Vuitton items.</p><p>To further demonstrate its commitment to eradicate counterfeiting, the company even sued popular singer Britney Spears for using a fake Louis Vuitton product in one of her music videos. Claiming that the video was an attack on its brand and the image the company was trying to project, Louis Vuitton also included Sony BMG and MTV Online in the suit. Eventually, Spears was found innocent, but Sony BMG and MTV Online were both levied hefty fines for their infraction.</p><p>And that brand and image that the company is trying to project involves exclusivity and extreme luxury. Louis Vuitton products are known not only for its durability and craftsmanship, but also for its price and value.&nbsp; They may be costly, but Louis Vuitton products are mostly keepers, meaning you can own and use them for the rest of your life. So if you want to get real value for money, why not try some of the most expensive Louis Vuitton items of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vienna-minimalisa-women-s-shoes---4-500><strong>Vienna Minimalisa Women’s Shoes - $4,500</strong></h2><p>The Vienna Minimalisa High Boots were part of the company’s 2005 to 2006 collection of Fall and Winter clothings. The high boots are made from the finest ostrich skin and features a four and a half inch heel. It may have minimal in its name, but the price is definitely far from it.&nbsp; Priced at four and a half grand, this boots are certainly made for a woman to walk with.</p><h2 id=louis-vuitton-golf-bag---9-050><strong>Louis Vuitton Golf Bag - $9,050</strong></h2><p>If you cannot drive a golf ball like Tiger Woods or putt like Rory McIlroy, you can at least try to outshine them with your golf bag. The Louis Vuitton golf bag has a base and a handle made from the hide of a cow. The shoulder strap is also made of cowhide and features a padded canvas. It also has a travel cover, as well as six departments that you can store all your golf trinkets in. Also, if your tee shot is not as straight and through as that of the best golfers in the world, you can at least admire where it came from with the Louis Vuitton tees. Four of these are included in the golf bag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=manhattan-richelieu-men-s-shoes---10-000><strong>Manhattan Richelieu Men’s Shoes - $10,000</strong></h2><p>Made and painted with hand, the Manhattan Richelieu from Louis Vuitton was created to showcase the tradition of the luxury brand, combining detailed craftsmanship with a vintage style. It features waxed alligator skin and it includes a subtle perforation motif finished off with some complex stitching. The shoe has been earning raves since its debut as part of the company’s 2010 spring and summer collection.</p><h2 id=tribute-patchwork-women-s-handbag---45-000><strong>Tribute Patchwork Women’s Handbag - $45,000</strong></h2><p>In the ultimate tribute of the power of the Louis Vuitton brand, even a woman’s handbag that was pilloried by critics as downright ugly sold out almost immediately.&nbsp; The bag was called the Tribute Patchwork bag, and it was one of the most expensive handbags ever. Maybe the women who ordered it recognized its exclusivity, as only 24 copies were ever made. Perhaps, they saw its durability, as it was made from samples of 15 other Louis Vuitton bags from the company’s cruise and spring and summer collections.&nbsp; Definitely, they did not buy the bag for its look, as it looks like something that Frankenstein would use. It certainly was a case of the sum being a lot less than its parts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=campanas-maracatu-furniture---51-500><strong>Campanas Maracatu Furniture - $51,500</strong></h2><p>Part of the Objets Nomades series of Louis Vuitton, the Campanas’ Maracatu limited edition hanging travel cabinet is the most expensive item in the collection. The folding travel cabinet was created by the Brazilian design duo named Fernando Campana and Humberto Campana.</p><h2 id=coquille-d-oeuf-minaudiere---101-000><strong>Coquille d’Oeuf Minaudiere - $101,000</strong></h2><p>The bag was featured as part of the company’s 2012 line of spring and summer collection. It was meant as a tribute to the partnership of Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs, the same designer who created the Tribute Patchwork handbag.</p><h2 id=kusama-pumpkin-minaudiere-jewel-bag---133-430><strong>Kusama Pumpkin Minaudiere Jewel Bag - $133,430</strong></h2><p>Created by Yayoi Kusama, the bag features the designer’s trademark pumpkin design. Only five of this meticulously designed handbags were made.&nbsp; The small evening bags from pre World War II France inspired the design. It is made of pure gold, black resin and the finest metal.</p><h2 id=luxury-trunk---170-000><strong>Luxury Trunk - $170,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is Louis Vuitton without the famous luxury trunk? One of its trunks is valued at $170,000. The trunk has a canvas case and was custom made for the captain of the Australian national cricket team Michael Clarke. It was handcrafted in Paris and features a spacious compartment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGaln6jBbrHXqZynq5mrsm64zq6grGWmqra1wM6nZKKslaLAbrvFZpilpF2ptq6xjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./logan-paul-girlfriend-dating-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Is What Its Like To Date Logan Paul, According To His Ex-Girlfriends</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-cast-of-dreamgirls-who-has-the-highest-net-worth-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Cast Of Dreamgirls: Who Has The Highest Net Worth Today?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
