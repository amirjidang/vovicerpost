The two were both hosts and stars of the show, and spent a lot of time together even when they weren't working, according to insider accounts.</p><p>And in recent years, Lizzo has gushed about her man, saying she wants to be with him for the rest of her life.

Brooklyn said she met Lizzo, who was "standoff-ish" and apparently didn't like her. Brooklyn explained, after getting some negative comments that said Lizzo had no obligation to be nice to her, that the "vibe" was off, and that she felt alienated from her boyfriend while in Lizzo's presence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Myke's ex claimed that as soon as the comedian got a "big break," he took off with Lizzo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Show Support For Lizzo After This Comedian Mocked Her Appearance</a></span></p><p>Further, Brooklyn said she knew there was 'something going on' with her then-boyfriend and the singer, which led to her leaving him.

At the time, Lizzo was quite beloved, so Brooklyn might have made the right choice.</p><p>This was pre-Grammy win for Lizzo, but Brooklyn acknowledged that she kept Lizzo's name out of her mouth because she didn't think people would support her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the nature of the lawsuit against Lizzo, however, Myke's ex seemed to feel like it was time to speak up about the rapper's character, and that she felt vindicated in hearing the criticism of Lizzo's behavior.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a follow-up video</a>, she stated, "my ego wanted this," agreeing that she knew people would flock to her video to hear gossip about Lizzo.
