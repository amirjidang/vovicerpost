I feel like what is happening right now is exactly what I needed to not be this spoiled, entitled whatever, because what's happening now is testing who I am as a person.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It took away a lot of things. For about a year anything work-wise disappeared,” she said, referring to her family’s scandal.</p><p>Their family gained fame through their appearances in several reality shows, such as "Chrisley Knows Best," "Growing Up Chrisley," and "Love Limo," although these shows have since been discontinued, which greatly affected the overall family’s net worth.</p><p>However, some of the Chrisleys will be back on TV in the new spin-off show, which was announced last month. "For the first time we'll actually be allowed to touch on the legal matters and be outspoken about that,” Savannah said of what to expect from the unnamed docuseries.</p><p>"It's definitely testing me, but helping to be a bonus parent for my siblings, it's been the hardest but most rewarding job I will ever have," she continued. "I get out there every day and I wanna make a better life for these two kids. It's gonna touch on that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also admitted the show will delve into her dating life as a single parent. The 25-year-old reality star has taken custody of her 17-year-old brother, Grayson, and her 10-year-old niece, Chloe, during her parents' incarceration.</p><p>“I’m not their mom. I’m not their dad. I’m their sister and I get to love and guide them through life. Being a bonus parent is TOUGH,” <a href=#>she previously said on social media</a> of what it was like stepping into a parental role. “No one could ever add up to their parents. But these kiddos have shown me so much love, patience, grace, understanding, and appreciation!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this year, a court determined that Todd will be incarcerated for 12 years, while Julie will serve a 7-year sentence. Following their imprisonment, they will both be placed on 3 years of supervised release.</p><p>Todd and Julie faced charges in 2019 amid allegations that they submitted falsified paperwork to community banks with the intent of obtaining $30 million in fraudulent loans.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kevin Costner’s Ex-Wife Plans To “Enter The Workforce” After Losing Big In Divorce</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrJmmlruvrcdmmqGqmai5psWMmpumoaSoerW7jKynnqaUnruoecyopZ6xXaG2rLGMoqudZZ6aw6a%2BjKusp2WfqsFursSfpqudXaWus7HNrapmopGeuW6%2FxKernqaTmsBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./scott-baio-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Scott Baio Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./romain-dauriac-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Romain Dauriac Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
