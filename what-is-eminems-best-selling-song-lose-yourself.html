He also produces music for numerous other artists.</p><p>Moreover, the memoir he wrote in 2008, The Way I Am, and his work on 8 Mile also brought him some lucrative cash.

Moreover, 8 Mile, the movie which showcases "Lose Yourself" earned more than $240 million at the box office while its budget was a modest $41 million. Eminem must have also gotten a cut of that, on top of showing that he is a pretty good actor.</p><p>However, the hip-hop star also lost money during the same time. His <a href=#>on-again off-again relationship with Kim Scott</a> and their marriages and subsequent divorces resulted in <a href=#>costly separation agreements</a>. Nevertheless, it is difficult to guess how much money that Eminem directly earned from "Lose Yourself" was involved in these legal costs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his legal costs, some of the earnings from "Lose Yourself" may have gone to Eminem's philanthropy efforts. Because of his struggles with poverty as a child and teenager, he created the Marshall Mathers Foundation to help disadvantaged children in the Detroit area.</p><p>In the end, Eminem seems to have benefited from "Lose Yourself" more than in terms of money alone.
