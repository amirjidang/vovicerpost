He's&nbsp;had the opportunity to work with many celebs&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while making his films</a>. Whether he is acting alongside his costars or working behind the camera, he is a funny guy who just likes to make films with his friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">30 years in the spotlight</a>, Adam went from being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturday Night Live alumni </a>to being a household name, thanks to his iconic movies. He even started his own production company. Whenever Adam has a new film due for release, we can expect to see some familiar faces.</p><p>So who is close to Adam Sandler? Here's a list of his celebrity friends.</p><h2 id=david-spade><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>David Spade</span></h2><p>Seeing as Adam and David were on SNL around the same time, there was never any doubt that the two would stick it out as the best of friends. The first film they did was one where Adam did not star, but produced - it was called&nbsp;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. The second time they would collaborate was for the film,&nbsp;The Benchwarmers. Later on,&nbsp;they would be on-screen together for movies such as Grown Ups and its sequel.</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Drew Barrymore</span></h2><p>Moviegoers fell in love with The Wedding Singer, which might not be entirely praised, but is definitely a classic, with Adam and Drew as the main love interests. They also worked together on 50 First Dates and Blended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While appearing on Today, Adam revealed that he got choked up when Drew presented an honor to him, for his work in Uncut Gems. Their friendship has lasted for so long that it's basically stronger than steel. That's how close they are.</p><h2 id=chris-rock><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Chris Rock</span></h2><p>Like David Spade, you can expect Chris Rock to work with Adam on countless collaborations. He was also part of the 'Bad Boys of SNL', so their friendship goes way back. Recently, they worked on a Netflix film,&nbsp;The Week Of, and while it might not be one of their stronger films, it is nice to see them working together.</p><h2 id=maya-rudolph><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Maya Rudolph</span></h2><p>Both Adam and Maya have worked on SNL, but the latter joined years after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam was fired five years earlier</a>. The two would meet up and work on films, including 50 First Dates and the Grown Up films.</p><p>Adam also cast Maya in a Halloween-themed movie, according to&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly, so there will be one more example of these two working on the same project in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7 Celebs Adam Sandler Never Works With (And 8 He Always Does)</a></span></p><h2 id=dan-aykroyd><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dan Aykroyd</span></h2><p>Ghostbusters creator and actor, Dan Aykroyd, is probably the last person you expect to work with Adam Sandler...unless you've seen the movies he's appeared in. But the two have a cool friendship that somehow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired a theory connecting the Adam Sandler films</a>. They even got together to do National Caesar Day. They like doing things outside of just acting together.</p><h2 id=rob-schneider><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rob Schneider</span></h2><p>Adam and Rob have this sort of reputation for winning Razzies, but that doesn't stop them from having fun together as friends and actors. From SNL to Grown Ups,&nbsp;they have collaborated so many times that only a true fan would know how many projects they have worked on together.</p><p>They even&nbsp;referenced a similar line in cameos, which is, "You can do it!" Even if Rob could not reprise his role in Grown Ups 2, that did not stop them from working on future films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tom Cruise</span></h2><p>In rare cases, Adam has some friendships with stars who aren't costars. His bond with Tom Cruise is unique and Adam has stuck up for Tom when news outlets were invading Tom's private life, as reported by People Magazine.</p><p>Adam did, however, got the chance to work with Tom's ex-wife, Katie Holmes, and joked about working with her on Jack and Jill,&nbsp;"It's a PG movie, no worries, nothing is going to happen. In fact, anything I do with your wife in the movie, you can do with my wife in real life."</p><h2 id=allen-covert><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Allen Covert</span></h2><p>Before they made movies together, Adam and Allen were classmates at New York University. If there was a contest to reward the person who's done the most movies with Adam, Allen would be the clear winner.</p><p>They have starred in, produced, and wrote so many films that Allen has been dubbed "the guy in every Adam Sandler movie." These two are the perfect definition of partners in crime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Facts No One Knows About Adam Sandler</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-farley><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chris Farley</span></h2><p>Chris Farley left the world too soon, and his passing affected many of his SNL costars, especially David Spade. While Adam is not usually paired with Chris, they did have a wholesome friendship that some people remember fondly, 23 years later. Adam paid tribute to Chris by doing a tribute song in his Netflix special,&nbsp;Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh, and even performed it live on SNL when he hosted in 2019.</p><h2 id=judd-apatow><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Judd Apatow</span></h2><p>Like Allen, Judd also went to the same university as Adam and the two have been friends for a very long time. He was even roommates with Adam, sharing a $900 apartment. They were not living a luxurious life back then.</p><p>They would eat out once a month, just to make meals an occasion, and they got into some silly quarrels, but also worked together on stand-up and writing jokes. While starting out, the two managed to find success in their own ways. They occasionally work together, here and there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-james><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kevin James</span></h2><p>If a movie with Adam includes Chris Rock, Rob Schneider, and/or David Spade, you better not count Kevin James out. He and Adam starred in&nbsp;I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry and their chemistry was incredible, both on and off-screen. They know how to make each other laugh and their work together is expanding, with the positively-received&nbsp;Hotel Transylvania franchise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Facts That Reveal Who The REAL Adam Sandler Is</a></span></p><h2 id=salma-hayek><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Salma Hayek</span></h2><p>Adam and Salma managed to show off amazing chemistry in the Grown Up movies and, thankfully, they didn't stop there.</p><p>Their friendship went further when they paid a touching tribute to their on-screen son, played by the late Cameron Boyce. Even though they are not married in real life, they look like they could be a great couple, given the loving thoughts they had of their gone, but never forgotten, costar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steve-buscemi><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Steve Buscemi</span></h2><p>As one of his older friends, Steve&nbsp;Buscemi has made some appearances as paranoid characters in Adam's movies, including Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer, and Big Daddy. According to Tracking-Board, Airheads sparked what is arguably one of the best Hollywood friendships in comedic history. They've worked together umpteen times, and we can see this going on for a long time.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston</span></h2><p>If there is one other actress that could team up with Adam as the friend/love interest, Jennifer Aniston would take that spot, alongside Drew Barrymore. Adam and Jen have known each other for three decades but only started collaborating in 2011, with&nbsp;Just Go With It.</p><p>Then, they would work together again, on the Netflix film,&nbsp;Murder Mystery. Since the two are really tight in real life, there's definitely a possibility of them working together in the future, whether for Netflix or other production companies.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Sweet Things Fans Don’t Know About Jennifer Aniston And Adam Sandler’s Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZmdYsCiusOlnKtllpa6sMHSZp2roZWjsbR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-boy-meets-worlds-trina-mcgee-was-really-cut-from-the-series-finale-angela-shawn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Boy Meets World's Trina McGee Was Really Cut From The Series Finale</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-tyrus-wife-ingrid-rinck-494303-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Tyrus Wife; Ingrid Rinck?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
