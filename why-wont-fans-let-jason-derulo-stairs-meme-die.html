But although Jason himself refuted claims that it's him in the photo, and despite evidence that the person in question didn't even resemble Derulo at all, the meme just won't die.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So why is the viral meme&nbsp;still trending all these years later?</p><h2 id=where-did-the-jason-derulo-stairs-meme-come-from>Where Did The Jason Derulo Stairs Meme Come From?</h2><p>The original 'Jason Derulo has fallen down the stairs' meme <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">originated in 2011</a>, after someone fell down the stairs at the Cannes Film Festival. But it did take a while before anyone decided to attach Jason's name to the spoofed pic.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears Fans Have An Amazing Alternative To That Justin Timberlake Meme</a></span></p><p>In 2015, people started suggesting that it was Jason in the photo, incorrectly attributing the image to the 2015 Met Gala. One single Tweet got the ball rolling, setting off a meme chain that doesn't seem to have stopped since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-s-really-in-the-jason-derulo-stairs-meme>Who's Really In The Jason Derulo Stairs Meme?</h2><p>Onlookers (well, Twitter users at least) swear it was Jason who fell, but in reality, it was some unnamed person who was accused of "rushing" the red carpet. It appeared that the random man in a white suit had broken into the Cannes festival and wasn't really supposed to be there.</p><p>He wasn't someone famous -- and he doesn't even have the same skin tone as Jason Derulo to begin with.</p><p>The light-skinned man, who happened to have dark hair, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly tackled by someone in a black suit</a> as he came down the stairs at Cannes. What's most interesting about the original picture is that Jason wasn't even&nbsp;at the Met Gala in 2015 -- and he apparently wasn't at Cannes in 2011, either.</p><h2 id=why-won-t-fans-let-the-jason-derulo-stairs-meme-go>Why Won't Fans Let The Jason Derulo Stairs Meme Go?</h2><p>The short answer as to why fans don't want to let the Jason Derulo meme die is that they're&nbsp;not fans. The people who love to circulate the meme, giving it new life each time, are typically critics of Derulo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of his music (and his TikTok videos) realize that the singer doesn't appeal to all audiences. And the meme continuing to circulate a full ten years after its first iteration is proof that some people just&nbsp;don't like&nbsp;him. Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the way he unceremoniously dumped his famous ex</a> is another reason why some fans don't love him anymore.</p><p>But some fans have shared the image to carry the joke onward. In fact, someone seems to re-share the image, with a new meme-y caption, every time there's an awards ceremony of any kind. "Jason Derulo falling down the stairs" has been circulated for the 2020 Golden Globes, the 2020 Emmys (which were, quite hilariously, broadcasted over Zoom), and more.</p><p>And part of the fun has been the puns fans came up with as captions; "Jason Derolled down the stairs" is a popular one.</p><p>Not that Jason really cares; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's too busy making mega-bucks on TikTok</a> to care about an old meme, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Jonas Shares Meme Of His Hairstyles Over The Years</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrLyvwIyfmKerXaGytXnJmqqopl2ZsrPBy6hkrKyRnr%2B0ecyepJ5llJ6ycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yidarton-maxi-dress-jersey-cotton-flattering-comfy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yidarton Maxi Dress Is the Cozy-Chic Find of the Year</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./richest-cast-member-that-70s-show-ashton-kutcher-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is The Richest Cast Member From 'That '70s Show' Today?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
