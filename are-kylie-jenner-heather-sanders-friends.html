But she does seem to circulate through some BFFs. After all that drama with Jordyn Woods, no one can blame Kylie for keeping some friends at arm's length.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordyn was practically family, which probably made the dissolution of their close relationship even harder. Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordyn Woods has forged her own path since the Kylie split</a>.</p><p>But once Jordyn was out of the picture, Kylie started spending more time with other gal pals like Sofia Richie, though didn't last&nbsp;too long; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once Sofia split from Scott Disick, she went off to do her own thing</a>, too.</p><p>Of course, there was also Jenner's&nbsp;other other BFF, Stassie Karanikolaou, who was photographed a ton partying it up with her pal. The two wore twinning outfits, posted up on IG (where else, right?), and traveled the globe together.</p><p>Still, Kylie formed other friendships outside of her small circle of gal pals. In fact, in 2019,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> called Heather Sanders "Kylie Jenner's Other Best Friend." But what's happened since then, and are these two Instagram influencers still friends today?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is Kylie Jenner’s BFF, Stassie Karanikolaou’s Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>Right after the news broke of the scandal involving Jordyn and Tristan Thompson,&nbsp;Elle reported, Kylie and Heather were out in Calabasas. Per the mag, Kylie and Heather met at Kendall's Sweet 16, where Tyga performed. Tyga's best friend is King Trell, who is Heather's husband today (and was her fiancé then).</p><p>And though Heather hasn't made as many headlines as Kylie's other friends, she was there for her BFF when it mattered: the two were pregnant at the same time (Heather had her second daughter around the same time Stormi was born) and Heather threw Kylie's gender reveal party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a while, tabloids were reporting that Kylie had replaced Jordyn with Heather. But then, news dropped off, leaving fans wondering what happened.</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie did a purge of her social media in January of 2021</a>, unfollowing a handful of folks, Heather&nbsp;didn't seem to rank highly on fans' checklists. At the moment, though? It appears that neither Heather nor Kylie follows the other.</p><p>The two don't appear to have any photos together either; if they do, the images were pre-pandemic for sure. And while social media may not be a huge indicator of how well two people get along in real life, fans know that Kylie's never been shy about promoting her girls online.</p><p>Therefore, fans can assume that though Heather and Kylie may not have had a huge falling out, they likely aren't that close anymore. Still, there's some sign that the two aren't complete frenemies; Kylie recently liked a post of Heather's, where the entrepreneur shared her very first billboard for her brand, Sorella!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as how often the two mamas talk or whether they're planning any kind of collab? No one knows for sure, and only time will tell whether they'll rekindle their BFFness.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think Kylie Jenner Is Launching A Tequila Brand</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51doMattcRmoZ6mnpq%2FbrTEmquhnaJiwKK6w56prGWWp7amusOsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./baron-vaughn-is-not-gay-wife-girlfriend-and-married-life-revealed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Baron Vaughn Is not Gay: Wife, Girlfriend and Married Life Revealed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anton-yelchin-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anton Yelchin Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
