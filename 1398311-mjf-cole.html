In some ways, that’s inherently true; by heading AEW All In, which is set to have roughly 80,000 fans in attendance, it will be the main event of the biggest show in AEW history. Critics may disagree with Khan’s claim, but there’s no doubting the clear importance of his match.</p><p>That makes the road up to his point especially satisfying. While some matches at AEW All In have felt thrown together, the story with MJF and Adam Cole has been a remarkable ride that stretches back to early June. Since then, it has played out in a compelling way that has only been rivaled by a few AEW storylines. From the on-screen storytelling to the real-world factors involved, Adam Cole vs. MJF has firmly cemented its spot as a fitting main event on such a high-stakes show.</p><p>AEW has taken fans on an emotional ride with this program. It started out as a bitter rivalry, as the two stars traded harsh shots on the June 7 episode of AEW Dynamite. They faced off in a thrilling match on the June 14 episode, and they battled to a time-limit draw. Tensions remained high for a few weeks, but the story took a turn when the duo were paired up in the AEW Blind Eliminator Tournament.</p><p>Wrestling fans have been conditioned to expect “Can they coexist?” storylines when rivals are thrown into a tag team. AEW easily could have taken that approach here. Instead, MJF and Adam Cole gradually warmed up to each other, as they agreed to make a true run at winning the tournament.</p><p>This shift led to a series of vignettes that allowed MJF and Adam Cole to hit home runs with the combination of their comedic timing and their emotional delivery. From MJF admitting that he had never had a friend to play videogames with before to the duo’s trip to a trampoline park, it was clear that AEW had something special here. The trampoline park was a personal favorite highlight, as MJF recreated the Billy Madison dodgeball scene, and one rude kid pushed Adam Cole to the dark side.</p><h2 id=h-mjf-and-adam-cole-a-turn-is-coming-but-who>MJF And Adam Cole: A Turn Is Coming, But Who?</h2><p>That segment illustrated a key theme of the storyline; MJF and Adam Cole have rubbed off on each other, for better or worse. MJF has essentially turned into a babyface by saying he’s the fans’ scumbag and cutting heartfelt promos about how Cole has helped him open up. Meanwhile, Cole has increasingly flashed heel tendencies and foreshadowed a stark turn, as seen on the August 23 episode of AEW Dynamite, where he said MJF reminded him of who he truly is.</p><p>The loose heel/face dynamic has progressed throughout the storyline, particularly as the title match has drawn near. MJF and Cole have heavily teased turning on each other with each passing week, so much so that it feels like a guarantee. But confidently predicting which way the pendulum will swing is practically impossible. At first, it seemed natural that MJF would turn. After all, he’s the self-proclaimed devil. But AEW has already went down that road, as MJF was a semi-babyface before aligned with William Regal to beat Jon Moxley at AEW Full Gear.</p><p>Adam Cole stabbing MJF, supposedly his best friend, in the back to win the title would open up some interesting possibilities. Most notably, it would open the door to a genuine babyface run for MJF. Cole has always thrived as a heel. It seems like a more natural fit for him, at least to this NXT Black and Gold fan. He still has the babyface rub that stems from his return to the ring following his struggle with his health. However, that shouldn’t preclude a heel turn.</p><p>The narrative prospect of MJF finally being himself vulnerable, only to have his friend betray him, could be too juicy to pass him. It would serve as a fork in the road for “The Devil.” He could shut down and become more twisted than ever or lean more heavily into his new identity as “our” scumbag.</p><h2 id=h-real-life-factors-influence-mjf-vs-adam-cole>Real-Life Factors Influence MJF vs. Adam Cole</h2><p>There are plenty of real-life factors at play here as well. When the title match first became the clear direction, it was the beginning of summer. Then, MJF’s “bidding war of 2024” was still several months away. Now, with the start of September just days away, MJF’s free agency is right around the corner. MJF continues to state that his contract is up on January 1, and he has made it clear that he’ll go to the highest bidder.</p><p>Could it all be a work? Perhaps. But if fans take MJF at his word, his free agency is rapidly approaching. With that in mind, AEW is running out of big-time events for the next champion’s crowning moment. If it’s not All In, All Out and Full Gear are the only pay-per-views remaining this calendar year. Plus, there may not be a more special occasion than All In, the biggest wrestling show in recent memory.</p><p>The importance of the win in that match cannot be overstated; the victor will go down in AEW history. Does AEW want to give that honor to someone who might not be with the company in a few months? Maybe it’s naive to think that giving MJF such a major win could earn some brownie points in the company’s bid to get him to stay. Either way, MJF’s contract status looms large over this title match, just as much as the excellent storytelling that has built it up on-screen.</p><p>No matter what happens, AEW All In promises to be a fascinating, must-see conclusion, and we can’t wait to see how it plays out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJyb2xpYWK6q7KMnKalnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alan-saldana-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-89764-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alan Saldaa Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-celebs-who-got-trapped-by-their-significant-others.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Celebs Who Were &amp;quot;Tricked&amp;quot; By Their Significant Others</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
