To commemorate his 39th birthday earlier this year, the couple spent time at home cooking up some Persian-style chicken kabobs, saffron rice and tzatziki for dinner – a moment both of them relished immensely.</p><p>Fans of actor Henry Cavill and his girlfriend, stuntwoman Natalie Viscuso, were delighted when the couple shared a photo from the premiere of Enola Holmes 2.&nbsp;</p><p>Their enthusiasm only grew when Cavill revealed in the caption that he and Viscuso had been putting their culinary skills to work by preparing all new recipes found online. The pair looked stunning together; Viscuso wearing a beautiful cream gown, with Cavill in a smart pin-striped suit and red tie. After two years together, it’s clear that their love keeps growing each day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Overview of Natalie Viscuso’s Life</h2><p>Natalie Viscuso burst into the global spotlight in 2005 after her appearance on MTV’s My Super Sweet 16.&nbsp;</p><p>She was seen living a luxurious lifestyle in a US$5 million mansion and celebrated her US$450,000 birthday party – both of which were quite at odds with the modest upbringing that British media reported she had.&nbsp;</p><p>She soon attained an undergraduate degree from the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts in 2011, aided by her involvement in extracurricular activities and the academic honors she received along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>This eventually led to Viscuso becoming a successful business executive in the U.S today.</p><p>Rebecca Viscuso has certainly had a formidable career, having worked with some of the most well-known names in entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>Her journey began at the studio responsible for producing DC Comics’ Man of Steel starring Henry Cavill, and it has only gone up from there.&nbsp;</p><p>She is now leading projects for HBO Max, Showtime, Hulu and Apple through her position as head of television at Vertigo Entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Viscuso was formerly Vice President of Television and Digital Studios at Legendary Entertainment– the company which produced Cavill’s Man of Steel (2013), as well as his more recent film Enola Holmes (2020).&nbsp;</p><p>Rebecca is an industry leader whose impressive portfolio speaks volumes about her talents and success.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Viscuso’s Mother Death</h2><p>In 2017, Alyse Viscuso shared a heartbreaking post about her late mother Tammie Kay Baumann, who had died after a long battle with cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>To aid in her diagnosis, Viscuso established a GoFundMe page to explain her mother’s rare form of the disease – epithelioid angiosarcoma.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, this cancer proved an arduous medical foe. It is known as one of the rarest and most destructive forms of cancer today, making it an exceptionally deadly challenge for Tammie and her medical team.&nbsp;</p><p>The extraordinary dedication given by her family and doctors was not ultimately enough to defeat this villainous illness – rendering Viscuso’s tribute all the more poignant.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC0xKepsmWTlsOquMtmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-mike-beaton-british-airways-pilot-bragged-about-partying-with-cocaine-before-flying.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Mike Beaton?
