I’ll tell you one thing more: ‘Hi, my name is Elle King [and] <a href=#>I’m f—king hammered,’”</a> she yelled at a fan in the audience during the concert. The Opry issued an apology the following day.</p><p>“That day was a really big day dealing with what I was going through, and that I’m still going through,” King admitted on the Thursday podcast. “I suffer from severe PTSD. That day, I hadn’t eaten, I hadn’t slept in days, and I was really overwhelmed. I was like a shell of myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Elle-King-Had-Disassociated-During-Drunk-Grand-Ole-Opry-Performance-2.jpg><p>The singer continued: “I take one shot too many, and I’m just not there in my body, I’m not there. I don’t remember it. All I remember — I don’t even remember what I said. I know now what I said. I said, ‘I’m Elle King, and I’m f—king hammered,’ and I got the curtain dropped on me.”</p><p>Looking back at the incident, King admitted she only gets “flashes” of what occurred that night, telling Handler that she “100 percent disassociated.” King can remember “sobbing” on her dressing room floor.</p><p>“I was mortified,” she added. “I hand wrote an apology letter to the Opry. And I hand wrote an apology letter to Dolly.”</p><p>Parton, 78, is “proof that angels exist,” King said. “She just gave me really kind words and told me, ‘Well, Dolly’s not mad at you, why should the world be?’ And made me laugh.”</p><p>Two months after the January incident, <a href=#>King broke her silence</a> via Instagram.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“To everyone sending me love because I’m human and already talked to Dolly 💅 I love you,” she wrote on March 10. “To everyone who told me to k*ll myself I love you too.”</p><p>Parton, for her part, <a href=#>showed support for King</a> the month prior.</p><p>“Elle King is a doll,” the country music legend told E! News in February. “I called her and I said, ‘You know, there are many F-words. Why don’t we use the right one? Forgiveness, friends, forget it.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepJyaeqy1zaBknaGjlsC0u8KimK2dlGKxtr7Ip55mnKKqu6x5xquYp5xdpLmmec6pqbJloJq%2Fp7vRppinm5Vk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-watson-reveals-subscription-to-explicit-website-w165383.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Watson Reveals Subscription to Explicit Website</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./discover-is-eliminating-these-5-credit-card-benefits-in-2018.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Discover is eliminating these 5 credit card benefits in 2018 WSOC TV</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
