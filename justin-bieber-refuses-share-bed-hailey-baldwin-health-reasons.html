One report from March says Justin, 29, and Hailey, 26, struggle a lot with trust issues. "They got married very young and didn't know what they were getting into, and it's been up and down ever since," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Radar Online.</a></p><p>The insider explained that the attention surrounding Justin’s past relationship with <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, which has resulted in a years-long feud between her and Hailey, has taken a toll on their marriage. Selena and Justin dated from on-and-off from 2010 to 2018, before calling it quits the same year Hailey and Justin tied the knot. The pair have denied there was any infidelity, despite the timeline of their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Hailey's always been insecure over Justin and Selena," the insider went on. "People saw them as them as this perfect couple, which is far from the truth, but Selena is so likable."</p><p>Last month, resurfaced footage showed Justin freaking out at Hailey after losing an arcade game, leading fans to call him out via social media for how he treated his wife. Needless to say, the arcade incident plus Justin’s admission to sleeping apart isn’t helping stave off the rumors of marital problems.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrquknrtursiemZ6qXaeyp8HSnqpmq5iWv6Z5wZ6bZqCRnrmmxYybmKWcp567brTEmqOtoF2nsqK%2FzqeqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kari-byron-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kari Byron Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joseph-scalia-obituary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joseph Scalia Obituary: The Life &amp;amp; Legacy OfBranchburg Native</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
