The show is for members of <strong><a href=#>Bachelor</a> Nation</strong> to come to find love after disappointment and heartbreak on their respective seasons. While the ultimate goal of this show is to find love, it seems to be a hard one to reach. Some couples have been able to achieve it, however, like couples <strong>Ashely Iaconetti</strong> and <strong>Jared</strong><strong>Haibon</strong>, and <a href=#><strong>Hannah Godwin</strong> </a>and <strong>Dylan Barbour</strong> to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you are watching this season of Bachelor in Paradise, you would know the controversies of multiple couples who walked on the beach. There have been several accusations of these individuals having relationships prior to the show, somewhat defeating the purpose. These contestants are not the first whose integrity and intentions have been questioned when they appeared on the show. In fact throughout Bachelor history there have been quite a few.</p><h2 id=brendan-and-pieper><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brendan and Pieper</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Brendan Morais</strong> was among the first group to enter Paradise. He initially had a connection with <strong>Natasha Parker</strong> as the pair swapped roses at the first two rose ceremonies. However, Natasha became frustrated as the connection was moving slowly, and began hearing rumors that he was already dating someone else: Pieper James. As the story unfolds, Pieper shows up on the beach and Brendan quickly ditches Natasha for her telling her he “had to do what he had to do” for them to be together. Fans quickly began to cancel the pair with both of them losing thousands of followers on Instagram and instead following Natasha. Both Brendan and Pieper have denied that they were exclusively dating before the show, but it looks like the damage has already been done. They left the beach on last nights episode and have stayed fairly quiet on social media since.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bachelor In Paradise’ Fans React To Brendan And Pieper’s Villainous Scheme</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-and-alana><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris and Alana</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Chris Conran </strong>entered the beach a bit later than Brendan, but basically pulled the exact same situation. He initially was into <strong>Jessenia Cruz</strong>, pulling her away from her previous relationship with <strong>Ivan Hall</strong>. Nonetheless, the second <strong>Alana Milne</strong> walked into the VIP party, Chris was done with Jessenia. Many thought it was sketchy that he would leave his connection with Jessenia immediately unless he had something stronger with Alana from before. Other cast members stood up for Jessenia and both ended up leaving Paradise, not as a couple, but separately. Hopefully there is no more of this nonsense for the rest of this season.</p><h2 id=victoria-p><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Victoria P.</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before the Brendan/Pieper and Chris/Alana fiasco, Victoria P’s intentions were brought into question. She had began forming a relationship with <strong>James Bonsall</strong>, but others weren’t convinced she was genuine as she frequently forgot his name. <strong>Tammy Ly</strong>, who had previous issues with Victoria on Peter’s season decided to tell James that she believed Victoria had a boyfriend back at home in Nashville. Victoria denied those allegations, but still self eliminated and returned home. However her odd comment in the limo to the airport “I don’t need to search to find something that I already have at home” leaves that up to speculation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Bachelor In Paradise’ Fans React To Victoria P.

The pair got engaged in May of 2019, but the engagement was short lived. By the ‘After the Final Rose’ episode, Hannah revealed they had broken up. Jed revealed he originally came on the show for the platform and to advance his country music career, but promised that once he met Hannah that all changed. What didn’t change was the fact he had a girlfriend back home, <strong>Hayley Stevens</strong>. “We spent the night together the night before he headed to L.A.,” Stevens told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a> back in 2019. “He told me [the show] was just an obstacle and we’d be stronger on the other side because of it.” Brown was devastated, revealing this wasn’t what she said yes to. 2 years later and Hannah is in a healthy and happy relationship with Adam Woolard proving everything happens for a reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jed's Ex Haley Stevens Confirms Romance With Hannah Brown's Brother Patrick</a></span></p><h2 id=thomas-jacobs><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Thomas Jacobs</span></h2><p><strong>Thomas Jacobs </strong>was sent home fairly early on <strong>Katie Thurston’s</strong> season of The Bachelorette. Early in the season he was a front runner, and quickly became disliked by the other men in the house. When asked if he thought about being the next Bachelor, Thomas answered yes. His time was doomed to end after that, as the men were quick to tell Katie about that answer. She sent him home in a rose ceremony stating “Your Bachelor audition ends tonight”. Thomas is now on this season of Bachelor in Paradise dating former Bachelorette <strong><a href=#>Becca Kufrin</a>.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demario-jackson><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>DeMario Jackson</span></h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> “ On paper at least, DeMario Jackson looked to have all the qualities we'd want for Bachelorette<strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong>.” The one big problem was his girlfriend Lexie. Lexie showed up to the week 2 group date to talk to Rachel saying he was her boyfriend of 7 months and still had the keys to her apartment. Yikes. Needless to say DeMario immediately was sent home, and went onto have another controversial appearance on Bachelor in Paradise season 4.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>‘Bachelor In Paradise’ Previews Frightening Evacuation Amid Tropical Storm</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmpuYmrmwvoycpqeslajBorrTrGSwoJ9ixKa602amp2WWpL9uwMeeZLCqn6O0br7EmqqopqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-mallah-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Mallah Net Worth How Much is Ben Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aubrey-anderson-emmons-talks-modern-family-spinoff.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aubrey Anderson-Emmons Talks Modern Family Spinoff</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
