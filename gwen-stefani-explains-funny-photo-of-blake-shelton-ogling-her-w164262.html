[I was] doing it as fast as I could and I literally opened the back of the truck and all the groceries fell out … and, like, I am trying to rush because everybody’s watching me … and all the other parents are getting mad. … So I’m, like, trying to open my door and, like, not one, but two basketballs and a football fell out,” Stefani explained. “So he was looking at the balls.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Embarrassing moment aside, things are going smoothly between the couple, who first stepped out together over Halloween weekend, following their respective divorces.
