There are very few things she's not willing to talk about on his long-running and acclaimed radio show but the topic of his kids is definitely one of them. Still, tidbits of information are occasionally revealed by the self-proclaimed King Of All Media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Howard loves discussing every single detail of his relationship with <a href=#>his second wife, Beth Stern</a> (nee: Ostrosky), he <a href=#>doesn't speak about his ex-wife, Alison Berns or their divorce</a>. At least, he does his best not to. When their marriage initially ended, he discussed going into therapy in order to salvage his relationship with himself and, most importantly, with his three daughters. It appears as though he's done just that. But part of that has meant the audience gets to know very little about, Ashley, Deborah, and Emily. But his oldest daughter has found her way into the news on multiple occasions, revealing quite a bit about herself and her relationship with her famous father...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-howard-stern-39-s-oldest-daughter-and-what-does-she-do>Who Is Howard Stern's Oldest Daughter And What Does She Do?</h2><p>Emily Stern has always been artistic and very spiritual. Early in her life, she caught the acting bug and pursued a career in theater. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with The Jewish Journal</a>, Emily first found these loves when she was involved in a choir at a Reform synagogue in Roslyn, New York, and at a Jewish summer camp that she attended. There were times when Howard would even feature his young daughter singing on his show in the 1990s.</p><p>Throughout high school, Emily continued to pursue her love of acting, something which both of her parents seemingly supported. She even went to NYU to continue her studies. However, this coincided with her parents' divorce (something she claims was "shattering" for her) and was not fulfilling to her. Despite this, she did graduate from the renowned school. Shortly after, she was cast in an off-Broadway play called "Kabbalah" at the Jewish Theater of New York. The play was a social satire about celebrities' obsession with the Jewish mystic practice of Kabbalah. She was to play<a href=#> Madonna</a>, the lead and would appear naked at the end of the performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cuba Gooding Jr. Never Appeared On The Howard Stern Show Again After This Controversial Interview</a></span></p><p>Howard reportedly warned his daughter that the press would have a field day with her since she was going to appear without clothes. Despite the warnings, Emily continued with the play. But she asked the director not to single her out as Howard Stern's daughter nor release images of her naked or barely-clothed when promoting it. Unfortunately, a horrible early review was leaked and the director reportedly betrayed her and released the images to the public. This caused Emily to drop out of the play and Howard to go on the defensive on Larry King Live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Emily] made a deal with a guy, and he betrayed her," Howard said to Larry King on his CNN show in 2006. "In a kid trying to find her own identity, it's got to be rough. She's got a father who's very infamous … And I think it would be difficult to figure out who you are in life and all of that. And I think she has done a beautiful job of it."</p><h2 id=emily-stern-currently-works-as-a-rabbi>Emily Stern Currently Works As A Rabbi</h2><p>Instead of pursuing a career in acting, Emily put her love of the arts into her career as a Rabbi. She has dedicated her life to studying the Hebrew Bible as well as all the extending literature. This learning process included studying Torah at Nishmat and becoming a rabbinic student at the Aleph Ordination Program.</p><p>"I had a desire, really to actually find a community and a world that actually resonated with me," Emily Stern <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told "Jew In The City" radio show in 2015</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her issues with the theater production, Emily went into a Jewish Renewal havdalah (the ending of Shabbat) ceremony at a yoga studio and it changed it life. "I walked into my first havdalah ceremony … and I had never seen something ritual and the way it was relating to the world in such a grounded way, she continued. "It really gave me an opportunity to begin to relate to matter in a way that was authentic for me."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Sitcom Legend Tried To Stop Howard Stern From Getting Re-Married</a></span></p><p>Emily contributes to the Jewish community as a rabbi and Torah scholar in New York but also through her spiritual music, most of which can be found on her Youtube channel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-howard-stern-39-s-relationship-like-with-his-daughter-emily>What Is Howard Stern's Relationship Like With His Daughter Emily?</h2><p>There's no doubt that Howard Stern's relationship with his eldest daughter is the most complicated. For one, Howard has never been one for religion and now his daughter has become engulfed in it. More importantly, Emily has been very public about her anger surrounding her parents' divorce. She also came out and slammed Howard dating (and eventually marrying) a woman 17 years his junior.</p><p>On top of this, Emily famously told The New York Post that her father's relationship with sex on his iconic radio show dissuaded her from wanting to date men.</p><ul><li><strong>Emily Stern has no reported dating history and appears to continue to be single unlike her younger sisters who are both in long-term relationships, one married and the other engaged.</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In recent years, she has walked back those comments, suggesting that she and her father have a much better relationship than they once did. The two also have a love of photography and art in common, so it's likely they bond over this. But unlike her sisters, Emily continues to live a very different life than her famous dad. But it seems to be the right one for her.</p><h2 id=what-do-howard-stern-39-s-kids-do-for-a-living>What Do Howard Stern's Kids Do For A Living?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Emily is currently delving into the world of Judaism and being a rabbi. Howard's other two daughters have made more traditional career decisions. Howard's youngest, Emily, is currently 29 and is a nurse practitioner. His middle daughter, Deborah has her Ph.D in reading, writing, and literature and lives with her husband in California. When Deborah married Colin Christy in 2016, she had her older sister officiate the wedding, signaling that she is supportive of Emily's career decisions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Is What Howard Stern's Youngest Daughter Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmn6ivkaexbr%2FTnqmnZZSWwqi0056pZp2dnrm6ecOoZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./valentine-thomas-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-210448-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Valentine Thomas Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-highest-grossing-danny-mcbride-movies-ranked.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Highest-Grossing Danny McBride Movies, Ranked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
