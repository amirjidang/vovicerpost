For ten seasons, Frank Gallagher and his progeny have made us laugh, cry, and celebrate their victories with them. It's been one heck of a ride and with Shameless coming to an end after the eleventh season, we can't help reminisce about all our favorite Shameless moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What makes Shameless such a success is the carefully picked cast and the hilarious, but somewhat relatable, storylines that sometimes take a dark turn. Each character on Shameless tells their own unique story, carefully woven into the craziness that adds to the overall aesthetic of the show. Whether a main or supporting character on Shameless, there are those we love and others we simply can't stand. Our favorite characters aren't saints either... most of them are shameless scoundrels.</p><h2 id=debbie-gallagher-makes-terrible-life-choices-but-is-trying-to-turn-her-life-around><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Debbie Gallagher Makes Terrible Life Choices But Is Trying To Turn Her Life Around</span></h2><p>Debbie Gallagher's character development on Shameless has been painful to watch, she is not a loveable character. Debbie's journey on Shameless has seen her transition from a kleptomaniac manipulative kid to a selfish irresponsible single mother. It'll be exciting to watch Debbie navigate life without Fiona and hopefully redeem herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helen-eacute-runyon-has-her-cake-and-eats-it-too><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Helené Runyon Has Her Cake And Eats It Too</span></h2><p>Helené Runyon got a bad rap for indulging in an inappropriate affair with Lip Gallagher. She was his professor and the dynamics suggest she used her position to lure the naive student, however that's not entirely the case. Granted, Helené has issues she needs to deal with, but that doesn't make her a villain.</p><h2 id=svetlana-is-the-rebel-we-wish-we-were><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Svetlana Is The Rebel We Wish We Were</span></h2><p>Unpopular opinion: Svetlana was one of the most entertaining characters on Shameless. You want to hate her because she is manipulative and cunning but you can't help but love her because she's a rebel making the most out of the hand she's been dealt. She is a complex character with a lot of personality.</p><h2 id=mickey-milkovich-loves-hard><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Mickey Milkovich Loves Hard</span></h2><p>Watching the neighborhood bully come to terms with his sexuality, and embark on a relationship his father does not approve of, was such a crucial moment in Mickey Milkovich's character development. He is living in his truth and that's such a beautiful thing to witness. Mickey loves hard and fights to be with the love of his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sheila-is-quirky-and-kind><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Sheila Is Quirky And Kind</span></h2><p>One of the most amazing things about Shameless is that it touches on mental illness. Sheila Jackson's struggle with agoraphobia was relatable. Sheila had her quirks and while most regarded her as the crazy lady, she was witty, loveable, and extremely kind. Sheila was one of the best characters on Shameless.</p><h2 id=there-is-still-hope-for-liam-gallagher-to-turn-out-normal><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>There Is Still Hope For Liam Gallagher To Turn Out... Normal</span></h2><p>The youngest Gallagher is no doubt the most adorable one of the clan. Out of all the Gallagher kids,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Liam has better odds of turning out... normal</a>. His character development has been watched with bated breath. However, his future looks promising and it couldn't have happened to a better character.</p><h2 id=sierra-morton-encouraged-lip-39-s-sobriety><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Sierra Morton Encouraged Lip's Sobriety</span></h2><p>Lip Gallagher has had his fair share of flawed relationships, and one relationship that viewers were behind was that with Sierra Morton. She seemed to genuinely care about Lip and encouraged his sobriety. In the midst of her struggles with her baby's father, she was a strong support system for the troubled Gallagher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-lishman-may-be-a-liar-but-he-took-care-of-fiona><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Jimmy Lishman May Be A Liar But He Took Care Of Fiona</span></h2><p>Jimmy Lishman is a gutless coward, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he lied so much it's hard to like him</a>. He was shrouded in mystery and his disappearing acts got everyone wondering what exactly he was up to when he was gone. The one thing we can't take away from him is that he genuinely took care of Fiona... before it all blew up in his face.</p><h2 id=get-yourself-a-girl-that-believes-in-you-like-mandy-did-lip><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Get Yourself A Girl That Believes In You Like Mandy Did Lip</span></h2><p>We can all agree that Mandy Milkovich has a few loose screws– she ran Karen Jackson over with her car and carried on as if nothing happened. Her obsession with Lip Gallagher yielded at least one positive thing: Mandy believed in Lip enough to fill out college applications for him.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Questions We Wish We Could Ask The Shameless Cast</a></span></p><h2 id=gus-pfender-the-hopeless-romantic><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Gus Pfender The Hopeless Romantic</span></h2><p>Gus Pfender and Fiona Gallagher tied the knot within a week of meeting each other. Granted, it was rushed and a horrible decision, albeit romantic. He was a hopeless romantic dealing with issues from his past relationship, believing Fiona was the right woman for him. You can't fault him for taking a chance on love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trevor-fights-for-what-he-believes-in><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Trevor Fights For What He Believes In</span></h2><p>Trevor was portrayed by trans actor Elliot Fletcher, <a href=#>a move applauded by the trans community</a>. Trevor was open about being trans and helped not only Ian but a lot of viewers understand the community. He was by far one of Ian's most wholesome and stable love interests. He is no Mickey though...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Shameless Characters We Wish Were Still Around</a></span></p><h2 id=frank-gallagher-is-resourceful-and-resilient><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Frank Gallagher Is Resourceful And Resilient</span></h2><p>The patriarch of the Gallagher household, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank is a manipulative low down dirty excuse of a father</a>. While he makes it hard for anyone to like him, can you ever imagine Shameless without Frank's antics? Dude has more lives than a cat– he is like a bad rash that won't go away.</p><h2 id=mike-pratt-is-a-perfect-gentleman><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mike Pratt Is A Perfect Gentleman</span></h2><p>Like Gus Pfender, Mike was the only other healthy relationship Fiona Gallagher had on Shameless. He was a perfect gentleman and would have given Fiona some much-needed stability. Mike Pratt was a great guy but like they say... nice guys finish last. It's a shame his run on Shameless was short lived.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nessa-chabon-and-fiona-gallagher-were-friendship-goals><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nessa Chabon And Fiona Gallagher Were Friendship Goals</span></h2><p>Fiona Gallagher's life has been one heck of a roller coaster ride, from her tumultuous relationships to raising her siblings and trying to provide for them. She definitely needed some girlfriends to lean on and Nessa Chabon proved to be a good friend to Fiona when she needed it the most.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Showing Fiona's Relationship Timelines On Shameless</a></span></p><h2 id=carl-gallagher-will-tickle-your-funny-bone><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Carl Gallagher Will Tickle Your Funny Bone</span></h2><p>Carl's character development has been entertaining to watch. He transitioned from being an extremely misguided and self-absorbed brat to a somewhat decent young man. He deeply cares about his family and turned his back on the life of crime he doubled in on earlier seasons of Shameless. We are rooting for Carl to make something out of himself.</p><h2 id=ian-gallagher-lives-life-on-his-terms><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ian Gallagher Lives Life On His Terms</span></h2><p>Ian's struggle with bipolar disorder and <a href=#>his refusal to accept his condition and take his medication led him down a destructive path</a>. Not only did Ian struggle with his mental health, but he struggled with his sexuality too. Despite his struggles, the redheaded Gallagher is living life on his terms and embracing his true self.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kev-may-be-clueless-but-he-is-pretty-awesome><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kev May Be Clueless But He Is Pretty Awesome</span></h2><p>Kev is a goofball, his and Veronica's antics on Shameless are priceless. Granted, he is almost always clueless, but that's overshadowed by his compassion and carefree attitude. Kevin is a wholesome character, he makes you laugh, question his stupid decisions, and fall in love with him at the same time.</p><h2 id=lip-is-a-genius-literally><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lip Is A Genius... Literally</span></h2><p>Lip was the first Gallagher to go to college, and we have watched various characters reference his intelligence throughout the show. Lip has the potential to make something of himself and change his circumstances but always opts to self destruct. Watching him crash and burn has been a disappointment. Hopefully he gets a chance to turn his life around.</p><h2 id=we-all-want-a-loyal-friend-like-veronica-fisher><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>We All Want A Loyal Friend Like Veronica Fisher</span></h2><p>Before Svetlana entered the picture, there was Veronica and Fiona. They were friendship goals, & Veronica practically helped Fiona raise her siblings. The loyalty and support Veronica offered not only to Fiona but the entire Gallagher household was admirable. Making their fallout in later seasons heartbreaking, we miss watching their extraordinary bond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fiona-gallagher-is-self-sacrificing><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Fiona Gallagher Is Self Sacrificing</span></h2><p>Fiona held the Gallagher's together, she was self-sacrificing and often put her family first. With a tough upbringing and tasked with raising her siblings, Fiona hasn't had it easy. She hasn't had much luck in her love life either, as Fiona's tragic life is worsened by her affinity for choosing men who lead her down a path of destruction.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Of Netflix's Most Addictive Original Series</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmq6fp7a1sYysn5qllaGytL%2BMnJ%2BaqpGYwaa%2B0mapmqabmrFuw8eoZLCdXayur8CMraZmmpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./regina-belle-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Regina Belle Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
