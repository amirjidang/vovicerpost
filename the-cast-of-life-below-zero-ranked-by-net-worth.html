While that may be attributed to the thrill that comes with lurking danger, the opportunity for viewers to see life outside of urbanization is also a salient reason. Much like <a href=#>Alone and Survivor</a>, Life Below Zero is an adventure-based reality show with a different premise. It is a documentary series that follows the daily and seasonal activities of subsistence hunters navigating life in the remote areas of Alaska.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="These Contestants Lasted The Longest On Alone">These Contestants Lasted The Longest On Alone</a></span></p><p>More than just for the thrill, viewers warmed up to the show for the cast members' unique stories and daring adventures. These casts, most of which are not native to Alaska, have learned to adapt and make a living in the extreme region, making their experiences a worthy one to follow. Has living in Alaska and featuring on the show been worth it? Well, let's find out. Here's the cast of <a href=#>Life Below Zero</a> ranked by net worth.</p><h2 id=agnes-hailstone---100-000><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Agnes Hailstone - $100,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Agnes was the matriarch of one of the most loved families on the survival-themed show. Unlike her husband, surviving the outer region is inborn; the reality star is an Alaskan native belonging to the Inupiaq tribe. Fans of the show were particularly fascinated by the Eskimo woman; she had expert knowledge of fishing, hunting, handling tools, and a unique tattoo rooted in her culture and beliefs.</p><p>Agnes and her husband, Chip, share six children, and as a family, the Hailstones embark on seasonal migration to appreciate the Alaskan wilderness.</p><h2 id=kate-bassich---100-000><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kate Bassich - $100,000</span></h2><p>Kate Bassich joined Life Below Zero with her ex-husband when the show premiered in 2013. While the former couple initially appeared to have a loving relationship, that was not quite the case behind the scenes of Life Below Zero, as she allegedly suffered abuse at the hands of her ex-husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While on the show, she raked in cash by jointly operating the mushing and survival school with Andy. Since leaving the show in 2015, Kate has been living to the fullest, vacationing, and updating her fans on her Facebook page.</p><h2 id=chip-hailstone---125-000><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chip Hailstone - $125,000</span></h2><p>Chip is one of the most loved cast members on the survival reality show, thanks to his courage in facing danger. Chip was swooned when he first visited Alaska, and what was meant to be a short visit turned into his lifelong abode. While Chip has been on the series since its inception, the survivalist was unusually absent for an entire season because he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">locked away in jail</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reality star found himself at the wrong end of the law for committing perjury and bearing false witness in cases involving his children.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Weirdest Things To Happen On Alone, According To Fans">The Weirdest Things To Happen On Alone, According To Fans</a></span></p><h2 id=jessie-holmes---200-000><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jessie Holmes - $200,000</span></h2><p>The reality star made his first visit to Alaska at 16, jumping off freight trains to reach his destination. After his first visit, Jessie worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years to fund a permanent move to the outer region. Since moving to Alaska, Jessie has won several sled dog races, provided carpentry services, and joined the cast of the documentary series.</p><h2 id=glenn-villeneuve---200-000><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Glenn Villeneuve - $200,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Glenn joined Life Below Zero from its inception in 2013 and quickly became a fan favorite. So fans were naturally distraught about his exit when he left the show without warning after the 11th season. Glenn's finances soared during his time on the show, but he hasn't let his exit stop his growth; he continued flourishing in his love for nature, hosts a podcast, and has built a 166-thousand-strong community on Facebook.</p><h2 id=andy-bassich---250-000><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Andy Bassich - $250,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andy Bassich is one of Life Below Zero's most popular cast members, so when he left to treat a life-threatening hip injury, viewers were curious about his whereabouts. Bassich would eventually return to the show after getting a clean bill of health, but fans were not particularly thrilled to have him back.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bassich is worth an estimated $250,000</a>. Despite making a pretty penny from the show, the survivalist has multiple income streams; he runs a mushing school, where he teaches participants the basics of handling sled dogs, and a survival training school, where he trains participants on surviving the extreme weather.</p><p>RELATED:</p><h2 id=erik-salitan---400-000><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Erik Salitan - $400,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Erik, being a survivalist is more than appearing on the show, as he and his family live full-time on the Alaska peninsula. After deciding to remain in the outer region when he moved there at 18 in search of greener pastures, Erick honed his hunting, fishing, and trapping skills.</p><p>Currently, Erick and his wife run a guide and outfitting business, Bushwhack Alaska, to guide and cater to seasonal visitors to the region.</p><h2 id=sue-aikens---500-000><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sue Aikens - $500,000</span></h2><p>Dauntless may be the perfect word to describe the reality star who lives by herself in an isolated zone in Alaska. The survivalist journeyed into the world of TV after being featured in Flying Wild Alaska, but she is famous for her appearance in National Geographic's Life Below Zero. While Aikens was still on the show's most recent season, she nearly threw in the towel after the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC put her life at risk</a> over the footage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From her job overseeing the Kivek River Camp and appearing on the show, she has amassed an impressive net worth of approximately $500 000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyonWakmZuybq7EpaawZaqav7B50ZqlpJ2UYq%2B6ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-gipsy-kingsstrista-pena-lyrics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Gipsy KingssTrista Pena Lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-did-the-amanda-show-pay-amanda-bynes-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Amanda Show Might Not Have Paid Amanda Bynes The Fortune That Fans Think</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
