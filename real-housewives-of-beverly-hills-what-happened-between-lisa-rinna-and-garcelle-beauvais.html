In season 9, Lisa Vanderpump felt isolated from the group as they thought that she planted the Puppygate story. In season 10, the focus was on Denise Richards and how she didn't want to keep filming. And in season 11, Erika Girardi's co-stars wanted to know every possible detail of her divorce and legal situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans have questions about <a href=#>Lisa and Erika's friendship on RHOBH</a>, Lisa has also had a lot of conflict with Garcelle Beauvais. Their friendship has been in a tough spot for a few seasons now. But has it gotten any better? Let's take a look at what really happened between Lisa Rinna and Garcelle Beauvais on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p><h2 id=why-were-lisa-rinna-and-garcelle-beauvais-fighting>Why Were Lisa Rinna And Garcelle Beauvais Fighting?</h2><p>In season 10 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, the group heard Brandi Glanville say that she and Denise Richards were romantically involved. This <a href=#>ended Denise and Lisa's friendship</a> and everyone wanted more details and information, especially from Denise. But Denise didn't want to talk about it and she also didn't want to film the entire season, and Denise famously stopped shooting before season 10 was even over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Rinna and Garcelle Beauvais fought</a> because of the situation with Denise Richards. According to Us Weekly, Garcelle didn't like how tough Lisa was on Denise and thought that she should be more caring and supportive.</p><p>Garcelle said in an interview with Us Weekly that she and Lisa might not be super close anymore: “I wouldn’t say it’s over. But we’re not going to have any sleepovers anytime soon.”</p><p>Garcelle also said that everyone should have been nicer to Denise: "I felt like [Denise] was being hit hard all the time and I felt like it was hard, time after time, after time. At some point, you have to believe someone’s truth or just go, ‘OK’ and move on, but it wasn’t that way. I just felt like they were too harsh on her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The season 10 RHOBH reunion was also really tough and made it difficult for Garcelle to stay good friends with Lisa. According to Entertainment Tonight, Garcelle let the producers know that she wanted to talk to Lisa and Kyle Richards so she could express herself and they could be honest with each other. Garcelle said, "It was important to me. I can't go on pretending like everybody's great when we have an elephant in the room. So they promised me that would be the case and they kept to their word." Fans love how honest Garcelle is and she always seems so real because of it.</p><p>While it was tense watching this conversation, Lisa did admit that she was tough on Denise and that being a lot softer would have been the best move.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What ‘RHOBH’ Star Lisa Rinna’s Life And Net Worth Look Like Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-season-11-reunion-of-39-the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-39>The Season 11 Reunion Of 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills'</h2><p>While the season 11 reunion of RHOBH saw Andy Cohen asking Erika Girardi questions, Lisa Rinna and Garcelle Beauvais also got the chance to talk about their friendship.
