It’s a funny thing, at this point it’s almost like a family relationship than it is strictly a business relationship. To be honest, at this point in time I can’t even tell you if we have a contractual obligation to it at this point, but we’re at the point where we just have conversations. ‘Hey, here’s what we’re going to do…’ and when this opportunity came up, we feel like being here is a strength.</p><p class=p1>It’s a learning experience for everybody. People forget that what happens here benefits all of WWE. Through our partnership with Full Sail, we’re not just training in-ring talent. We have producers and directors that are doing WrestleMania now and that level of stadium shows, that cut their teeth on that job here, and wouldn’t have had that opportunity otherwise,” Triple H noted.</p><p class=p1>The partnership goes so far beyond all of that, ‘we’re just renting out your live facility every Wednesday’ and we value that partnership at the highest of levels. I really mean that across the board. Full Sail is like family to us.”</p><p class=p1>Triple H later added that an announcement would follow, and confirmed the report that NXT would not be at Full Sail on March 11. Triple H said the school couldn’t change the commitment and they were OK with it, adding that WWE knew about it and it’s about what both sides need together and how they can support each other.</p><p>https://twitter.com/JJWilliamsWON/status/1232868547560431616</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;<a title="Triple H NXT TakeOver Portland Post-Show Media Call" href=#>Triple H NXT TakeOver Portland Post-Show Media Call</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBwam9wZGKAbn2QZqWxrF2WtrO1zaBkn6qfonq4w8Rmp56qlqS%2Frq3NnJxmm5Wjwaa%2B</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aarti-sequeira-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-141585-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aarti Sequeira Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-wrestling-superstars-who-lost-millions-in-divorce-settlements.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Wrestling Superstars Who Lost Millions In Divorce Settlements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
