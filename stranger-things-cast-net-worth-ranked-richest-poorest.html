This will substantially bump all the actors' net worths. Just how much will depend on how many episodes are shot. This is because all are paid on an episode-by-episode basis.</p><p>While there has been little change to most of the net worths of the actors, since 2020, Millie Bobby Brown went from $10 million to a $14 million fortune. As such, she is poised to bump Winona Ryder as having the most wealth of the actors on the show with an acting career that is currently on fire.</p><h2 id=noah-schnapp>Noah Schnapp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52359704-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Noah Schnapp's short career, he has been in films that have had staggering box office grosses.
