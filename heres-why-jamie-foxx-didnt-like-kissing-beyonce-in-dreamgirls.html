style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>In 2005, it was announced that <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce</a></strong> would be playing the role of Deena Jones in the award-winning flick, Dreamgirls, alongside the likes of Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Hudson, Danny Glover, and Jamie Foxx.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The latter, however, has since revealed that having to kiss Beyonce in the motion picture wasn’t something he was looking forward to, and that was mainly because Foxx had already built up a friendship with Bey and her husband&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z</a>, and while they weren’t married at the time production commenced, they had already been together for four years.</p><p>Taking that into consideration, it’s understandable why Jamie would be hesitant on locking lips with the “Upgrade U” vocalist, but being the professionals that they are, the two filmed the scene regardless and had Jamie never made light of his hesitance to kiss Beyonce, nobody would’ve ever known since the scene was believable nonetheless.</p><h2 id=why-didn-t-jamie-foxx-enjoy-kissing-beyonce>Why Didn’t Jamie Foxx Enjoy Kissing Beyonce?</h2><p>For those who’ve seen the movie, you’d be aware that there are quite a few kissing scenes in Dreamgirls, so when it came time for Jamie’s character, Curtis Taylor Jr., to lock lips with Deena Jones, the father of one revealed during his 2007 Unpredictable stand-up comedy show that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">making out with Bey was no easy task</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While most actors would have probably been swooning over the idea of getting to kiss Beyonce, Jamie saw things quite differently, and that was mainly because he’d also been considered a friend to the Carters — of course, everyone was well aware that this was nothing more than acting, but Jamie still couldn’t picture Jay Z out of his mind when the scene came up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Worried That Beyonce’s Second Ivy Park & Adidas Collection Will Sell Out</a></span></p><p>To make matters worse for the Django Unchained star, him and Beyonce had to practice their kiss on multiple occasions before it was filmed on camera, and every time they would near each other to smooch, the only thing running through Jamie’s head was that he was about to make out with Jay-Z’s girl, he recalled during his show in Madison Square Garden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, it seemed Beyonce was just as worried about the kissing scene, particularly because she didn’t have much experience as an actress, let alone filming such an intimate moment on camera.</p><p>In an interview with Digital Spy, the former Destiny’s Child lead singer gushed about the experience, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stressing that she was definitely nervous about it</a>.</p><p>“I guess you could say we had a love scene. We kissed. Now, I’m a singer/songwriter, that’s what I did first – I didn’t start out going to acting classes and people-kissing classes,” Beyoncé said, according to&nbsp;Digital Spy. “So that’s all still new to me.</p><p>To help her prepare for the scene, the mother of three noted that she had a lot of help from an acting coach who helped her channel the character to the best of her abilities — after all, Jamie and Beyonce were married on-screen and that relationship had to come across to the viewers watching the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Worried That Beyonce’s Second Ivy Park & Adidas Collection Will Sell Out</a></span></p><p>“Working with my acting coach made it easier. I just thought it was necessary for the character, we have to establish that they’re married,” she continued.</p><p>“Jamie was very professional, it was quick, and you know, it is what it is”</p><p>But when watching the movie, most would probably agree that the scene came off as believable, which is all that really mattered in the end, and considering that Jamie is still close with the Carters, it seemed Jay Z took no issue with it by any means.</p><p>During Awards season, Dreamgirls scooped up the award for Best Supporting Role (Jennifer Hudson at the 2007 Academy Awards, and three wins at the Golden Globes, including Best Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy, Best Supporting Role for Hudson, and Best Motion Picture).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Domestically, Dreamgirls earned $103 million at the box office and pulled in another $53 million worldwide, yet despite its success, this was one of the last movies Beyonce has done before turning her attention back to her music career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloé Kardashian Trends On Twitter After Fans Claim Her Latest Face Resembles Beyoncé</a></span></p><p>She had a lead role in 2009’s Obsessed and lent her voiceover talent in films such as The Lion King and 2013’s Epic, but for the most part, she’s put acting on the back-burner, which is understandable considering how much money Bey makes from each new album release.</p><p>In 2016, in support of her sixth studio album, Lemonade, Beyonce’s Formation World Tour grossed an incredible $256 million — and that was just from ticket sales. Once you add in album sales, streams and merchandise, those numbers are believed to have surpassed $300 million.</p><p>Still, that shouldn’t rule out the chances of Beyonce possibly returning to the big screen in the near future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is It Hard For Solange To Live In Beyonce’s Shadow?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmoZqlmZp6p7vXsWSdoZSjwW64yKScZqOZqMCqusZmmZ6xn6OwpnnIp2SdqpWWuqi10aWqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2021-how-xxxtentacion-achieved-a-net-worth-of-5-million-before-his-untimely-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How XXXTentacion Achieved a Net Worth of $5 Million Before His Untimely Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fluffy-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fluffy Net Worth How Much is Fluffy Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
