The lyrics appear to take issue with their age gap – Taylor was 19, while John was 32 when they began dating. They dated briefly from December 2009 to February 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans have even interpreted the lyrics to be Taylor suggesting John took advantage of her, considering she was only a teenager. “Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong / Don’t you think 19 is too young / To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so? / I should’ve known,” the lyrics read.</p><p>Now that an updated version of the T-Swift song is set to debut on streaming services, it’s re-awakened Taylor’s fanbase’s disdain for John.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Kelly Clarkson Actually To Thank For Taylor Swift's Re-Recorded Albums?</a></span></p><p>It appears Taylor has been anticipating the backlash, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she addressed it at a recent tour stop in Minnesota</a>. Before giving an acoustic version of “Dear John,” she seemed to ask her fans not to go after John once the new album drops.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was hoping to ask you, as we lead up to this album coming out, I would love for that kindness and that gentleness to extend onto our Internet activities,” she said on stage.</p><p>Taylor then explained she’s not re-releasing the album to dwell on the past, but rather to celebrate her musical accomplishments.</p><p>“I’m putting this out now because I want to own my music and I believe that any artist who has the desire to own their music should be able to. That’s why I’m putting out this album,” the musician continued.</p><p>“I’m 33 years old. I don’t care about anything that happened to me when I was 19, except the songs I wrote,” Taylor went on. “So, what I’m trying to tell you is that I’m not putting this album out so that you should go and feel the need to defend me on the Internet against someone you think I might have written the song about 14 million years ago.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-admitted-taylor-rsquo-s-break-up-song-ldquo-dear-john-rdquo-humiliated-him>John Admitted Taylor’s Break-Up Song “Dear John” Humiliated Him</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/john-mayer-performing.jpg><p>Taylor has become notorious for writing about her ex-boyfriends, and it’s likely now an expectation for people who date her. But John Mayer has admitted he was “humiliated” after Taylor released “Dear John” and he became the target of intense backlash.</p><p>“It made me feel terrible,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told Rolling Stone in 2012</a>. “Because I didn’t deserve it. I’m pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do.”</p><p>Hopefully, for John’s sake, Taylor’s fans listen to her and leave him alone once Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) drops.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkpq0tHnHnqlmnpGjwG7AzmaqraegYq%2B2uMuyoKefXam1qr%2BMnq9mmp%2Bus7O1xKebZpldmbKkrcOeZJqepJq%2FbsDHnrBmmqKkuKZ51Klm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./royal-birkdale-154th-open.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 154th Open at Royal Birkdale</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./spike-lee-parents-birthday-letter-1234862756.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Spike Lee Pens Heartfelt Note To Parents In Celebration Of His Birthday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
