The Season 8 Chief Stewardess has received shade from fellow cast members for some of her on-board moves lately, but that doesn't mean she'll be edged out of the cast without a fight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For one thing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had a hand in firing Elizabeth Frankini</a>, although her team members weren't all on board with the decision. Questionable reasons for firing aside, Francesca is proving that she's got some clout on board, but her appearance on the show has gotten fans wondering about the newcomer.</p><p>What exactly did Francesca do before she joined 'Below Deck,' and is she really an expert on crew etiquette, enough so to fire one of the stewardesses beneath her?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About 'Below Deck Med's' $10 Million Production Cost</a></span></p><p>The answer to the question of Rubi's experience is no, she's not a more experienced yachter than her predecessor. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Online</a> quotes Rubi as saying that it's hard to compare her to Kate Chastain because "we both have different work experience backgrounds, on yachts and off yachts."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That sounds a&nbsp;little bit like avoiding the question of her relevant experience for the role, but it's true that the Australian chief stew does have some experience servicing similar clientele as the&nbsp;My Seanna.</p><p>In fact, Francesca worked in "event management" with high-profile clients, said&nbsp;ET Online. She also elaborated that she's a "very creative person" and that the skill is crucial for creating different experiences for guests.</p><p>She also noted that earning respect "from our peers and captain" was an essential part of the job. In that sense, Rubi has a way to go to catch up with Chastain, whose years of experience made her an ingrained part of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter how much prior experience Rubi has in the industry (or not), she can't compete with the relationships that Kate built with the crew. She also can't compete with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate's net worth at this point</a>... Still, Rubi&nbsp;did come straight off another yacht to join 'Below Deck.'</p><p>She explained that she had been on another boat for "the past couple of years" and wanted to really flex her creativity in a different role. And the reality star is already comfortable enough on the boat to want to come back for another season, noted&nbsp;ET Online, saying that she felt like she built a solid working relationship with Captain Lee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as the rest of her co-workers and that shade Kate keeps throwing? Fans will just have to wait and see how it plays out through the next season of 'Below Deck' -- though no schedule has been released by Bravo as of yet.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of Bravo's 'Below Deck' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqSfrHqlscKkZLCgkal6pbXDZp2rmZ6YsrSvwGaprpqZYrGwecGenaiqlWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-stephen-sondheim-children-wife-and-gay-partner-meet-his-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are Stephen Sondheim Children?
