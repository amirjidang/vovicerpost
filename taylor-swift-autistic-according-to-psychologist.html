The psychologist started the piece by saying, "Megastar isn't strong enough; we need a new word to describe the power of influence that is Taylor Swift circa 2024."</p><p>But later in the introduction, she revealed how she finds the Swift hype deceitful. "Now, through my training and working with people for so many years, I've developed a pretty good bulls**t meter," said Gillbee. She then listed "three of [her] very controversial opinions on the current celestial commander-in-chief to rattle some cages."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<strong>1.</strong><strong>She is Autistic</strong>," Dr. Gillbee wrote about Swift. "<strong>Although not possible to diagnose anyone without a proper assessment, my impression, based on clinical experience, is that Taylor is likely on the autism spectrum</strong>."</p><p>She added that "while autistic males are more likely to struggle verbally and appear emotionally aloof,<strong> females are usually more verbally skilled, empathic, and emotionally sensitiv</strong>e. However, <strong>they may struggle to manage and contain their emotions</strong>."</p><p>"Females on the spectrum are also often exquisitely sensitive to the human experience and the nuances of felt emotion, something Taylor puts to brilliant use in her music. The singer has spoken about using music to help her cope with overwhelming emotions and experiences."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gillbee also said that Swift's songs, Maroon and Lavender Haze may prove that she has a "common comorbidity of autism... <strong>synesthesia</strong>, a condition where sensory stimulus involuntarily elicits an experience in a different sensory pathway, such as seeing colors as feelings or perceiving numbers in specific locations or events."</p><p>The expert explained: "<strong>She regularly equates feelings to colors in her music</strong>, such as in the songs Maroon and Lavender Haze, and lyrics like '<strong>loving you was red</strong>,' '<strong>you showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else</strong>,' and 'I<strong> once believed love would be black and white, but it's golden</strong>.'"</p><p>Taylor Swift has been long criticized for "continuing to act like a teenager."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then there's Swift's "<strong>hypermobility</strong>," seen in her elbow trick in a 2016 interview with Vogue where she appeared to be double-jointed. Another sign is her "<strong>hyper focus</strong>" and "<strong>childlike quality.</strong>" Gillbee cited how the Grammy record-breaker "has spoken about <strong>her obsession with singing and fame</strong> that started at a very young age."</p><p>"To the point that she begged her parents to buy her a guitar and move to Nashville," Gillbee continued. "[Swift] has relentlessly pursued her goal of making it as a country singer. <strong>Her music also suggests that boys and dating are a particular hyper focus within Taylor's life</strong>."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-and-donna-kelce-s-relationship-got-off-to-a-complicated-start-but-the-two-are-closer-than-ever1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift And Donna Kelce's Relationship Got Off To A Complicated Start But The Two Are Closer Than Ever</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Donna Kelce may have made an awkward comment about Taylor Swift once, but the singer and Travis Kelce's mom have a special relationship.</span><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-39-blank-space-39-and-39-mirrorball-39-may-prove-she-just-quot-mimics-quot-other-people>Taylor Swift's 'Blank Space' And 'Mirrorball' May Prove She Just "Mimics" Other People</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-at-metlife-stadium-in-east-rutherford-during-her-eras-tour.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another thing Dr. Gillbee noticed about Swift's public demeanor is "<strong>masking</strong>." The former said "<strong>females on the autistic spectrum tend to be more adept at observing and mimicking human social cues</strong> than their male counterparts. They often imitate peers to fit in, even if the social skills do not come naturally to them." She then cited the performer's songs, Blank Space and Mirrorball as proof:</p><p>"As the singer said in her songs Blank Space , she can 'find out what you want. Be that girl for a month,'" said Gillbee, "and Mirrorball 'I'm a mirrorball. I can change everything about me to fit in.'"</p><p>The psychologist also claimed that it's why Swift seems "normal" when people meet her in person. "They can become so good at imitating that they almost do a better job at being whatever they are imitating than the thing itself," Gillbee said of the Cats star. "Celebrities and interviewers who meet Taylor often say they were blown away by how 'normal' she is. I think that <strong>her life is so abnormal that it’s not normal for her to be normal</strong>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "The fact that she comes across as more normal than most real 'normal' people you're likely to meet tells me it's effortful." She then quoted Mirrorball again. "As Swift reveals in Mirrorball, '<strong>I've never been a natural. All I do is try, try, try</strong>.' <strong>The masking is evident to me when watching Swift speak, in her exaggerated facial expressions and social cues</strong>."</p><p>Swift has been open about her mental health issues. Here are some of the battles she's shared with her fans:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>2019</p></td><td><p>Swift said she's "never been to therapy" despite singing she's "depressed" in I Can Do It With a Broken Heart (2024)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2019</p></td><td><p>Swift "needed to make music" to "preserve [her] mental health" after being "humiliated" by <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a> </strong>who<strong> </strong>called her a "b*tch" in his song and <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> who labeled her a "snake."</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Swift said in her documentary, Miss Americana, that she previously struggled with an eating disorder</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2022</p></td><td><p>In her song, Anti-Hero, Swift said: "When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room."</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-43.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Joe Alwyn's Tattoo Status Is Nearly As Mysterious As Whether Taylor Swift Is Secretly Inked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift may be broken up, but fans continue to obsess over the stars, including whether they secretly have tattoos.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-psychologist-said-taylor-swift-may-be-suffering-from-quot-vulnerable-narcissism-quot>The Psychologist Said Taylor Swift May Be Suffering From "Vulnerable Narcissism"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-7.jpg><p>While fans praised Swift's Anti-Hero for being an honest portrait of sadness, Dr. Gillbee thought it showed how the singer suffers from "<strong>vulnerable narcissism</strong>" or "covert narcissism," which the expert studied in her PhD thesis. She was particularly drawn to these lyrics in the song: "<strong>Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism</strong>? Like some kind of congressman?"</p><p>"Like all narcissism, it tends to come from a deep feeling of not belonging or not being good enough that a person subconsciously attempts to cope with by developing a false self," Gillbee said of Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that "the false self attempts to strategically gain a sense of belonging... In the covert form, <strong>this looks like an attempt to make oneself needed by being a universally liked helper type who is often self-deprecating and self-sacrificing</strong>." She then quoted You're Losing Me, where the 34-year-old billionaire described herself as "<strong>a pathological people pleaser. Who only wanted you to see her</strong>."</p><p>"This lyric reveals that while <strong>Taylor is aware of her dysfunctional approval-seeking behaviors, part of her still identifies as the victim who just wants to be seen</strong>," Gillbee assessed. "<strong>An adult longing to be seen indicates a wounding in early childhood</strong> related to a lack of mirroring."</p><p>In 2010, a 20-year-old Taylor Swift was too "shy" to discuss her personal life but said she "will say everything in [her] music."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkarBqr%2FToppmmZOYvLOwyKeeZqyfYr20xcKhpqWnl57AtXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./706881-best-wwe-championship-belts-of-all-time.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ranking the Best WWE Championship Belts of All Time</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./195913-photo-of-chris-jericho-kelly-kelly-kissing-at-a-ny-club.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Photo Of Chris Jericho &amp;amp; Kelly Kelly Kissing At A NY Club</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
