In June 2022, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported that the couple’s older child, Pierre, had been missing</a> since earlier in the month. The report added that he may be “in the company” of his father.</p><p>Paul was quick to respond to the allegations to deny his son was kidnapped. Rather, he said he took the toddler on an extended trip while he tried to look for work. However, the so-called trip came only days after CPS had been granted custody of Pierre, which made it seem like Paul was trying to evade the court’s decision and flee with the boy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Unbelievably Toxic 90 Day Fiance Couples Are Still Together</a></span></p><p>It’s unclear why Paul didn’t also take their younger son, Ethan. The 1-year-old was reportedly in the care of CPS when his older brother was reported missing.</p><p>Once the news went viral, Paul returned Pierre to state authorities, claiming it was all a misunderstanding. Paul and Karine have been trying to regain custody ever since.</p><h2 id=paul-amp-karine-rsquo-s-sons-were-put-into-foster-care>Paul & Karine’s Sons Were Put Into Foster Care</h2><p>In July 2022, Paul gave an update about the custody situation during an appearance on the Domenick Nati Show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The reality star made a series of startling revelations</a>, including that his and Karine’s parental rights were terminated, and their sons were currently in foster care.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul alleged that his estranged wife had initially been accepted into a government program offering financial assistance and housing after claiming she was a victim of human trafficking, which Paul has denied.</p><p>However, Paul implied that Karine has since lost the government benefits. “Karine works hard at any job she can to earn money,” he explained. “She has lost any government help from food stamps to medical. Lost her housing assistance.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Fan Favorite 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk Duos</a></span></p><p>In the same social media post, Paul said that their sons had been taken by Child Protective Services and were currently with a foster family. Paul said that even though Karine has been doing “everything CPS and the ‘harsh’ judge has asked her since December,” she was only allowed to visit their boys once a week for an hour at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul added that the court hasn’t given their family a “fair opportunity at reunification.”</p><p>“I have seen other judges allow a mothers opportunity to get their children’s custody back,” he added. “Our children miss their parents. The termination of our parental and custodial rights without a fair opportunity at reunification shows how corrupt the system is.”</p><p>Paul noted that there was a chance the boys could be placed in the care of one of his family members, but so far it hasn’t happened.</p><h2 id=paul-amp-karine-are-trying-to-raise-funds-to-fight-for-custody>Paul & Karine Are Trying To Raise Funds To Fight For Custody</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PaulKarine90DayFiance-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, it appears that Pierre and Ethan remain in the custody of CPS. Speaking to In Touch, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source said that while the situation is sad, the boys are doing very well</a>. “I am sure Pierre is very confused about why this is,” the insider explained. “Just sad for sure, but the boys are very loved and cared for.”</p><p>They added that the contact between Paul, Karine, and their boys is limited, but Karine is able to visit her sons once a week at a “special place” with supervision.</p><p>Paul and Karine have made it clear they plan to fight to regain custody of their kids. In September 2022, Karine turned to social media to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ask her followers to donate to a GoFundMe page</a> so she could hire a lawyer. She’s promoted the GoFundMe page several times in the months since.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul has also given sporadic updates online</a> about the custody situation.
