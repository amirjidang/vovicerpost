Unbeknownst to the crew, their reclusive hosts have some dark thoughts to share about their not-so-secret project.</p><p>Mia Goth has become a Hollywood darling in recent years, having honed her skills in independent films.</p><p>Her role in X promises a grittier side to her character, and fans are excited to see how she handles the role in the vintage-p*rn-slasher extravaganza.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mia Goth: Teen Model to Film Star</strong></h2><p>Goth was born in London, England, to a Canadian father and Brazilian mother.</p><p>Her maternal grandfather is the artist Lee Jaffe, an artist and photographer specializing in large-scale multimedia projects.</p><p>Goth’s maternal grandmother is the legendary Brazilian actress Maria Gladys. Gladys had begun her career on the stage, eventually making the transition to film, where she worked with some of Brazil’s most celebrated producers and directors.</p><p>Goth’s mother was just twenty when she gave birth and decided to relocate to Brazil to raise her with her infant daughter.</p><p>Five years later, they moved back to the United Kingdom. Goth briefly moved to Canada when she was 10, where she attended nine schools in a single year.</p><p>At that time, Goth claimed it was difficult to live with her father, eventually settling with her mother in London at the age of twelve.&nbsp;</p><p>Two years later, Goth was discovered by fashion photographer Gemma Booth while attending the Underage Festival in London.</p><p>She immediately signed with Storm Model <a href=#>Management</a> and appeared in Miu Miu and Vogue campaigns.</p><p>After finishing sixth form at the age of sixteen, Goth decided to audition for films, feeling she had nothing to lose.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mia Goth Is A Force Of Nature On Film</strong></h2><p>Her first role was in Nymphomaniac, directed by Lars Von Trier in 2013.</p><p>Nymphomaniac, a two-part erotic art film, follows Joe (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stacy Martin) as a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac who recounts her s*xual experiences to a middle-aged Bachelor (Stellan Skarsgård) as he helps her recover from assault.</p><p>The two-part film chronicles Joe’s experiences from adolescence to adulthood and is split into eight distinct chapters.</p><p>Goth appeared in the film’s eighth and final chapter, called ‘The Gun’ alongside Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe.</p><p>She then played Sophia Cambell in the British-French crime series The Tunnel.</p><p>Goth appeared in the music video for the Future Unlimited song ‘Haunted Love,’ directed by her Nymphomaniac costar Shia La Beouf.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, she was cast in the lead role in the post-apocalyptic thriller, The Survivalist. Goth followed this up with roles in the adventure-thriller Everest and the BBC crime series Wallander.</p><p>Not one to let herself be typecast, Goth made sure she had a wide variety of genres in her limited filmography.</p><p>She first ventured into horror with A Cure for Wellness in 2016 and was singled out for her supporting performance in the remake of Suspiria, directed by Luca Guadagnino.</p><p>Goth was introduced as the sweet-but-naive Harrie in Autumn de Wilde’s adaptation of the Jane Austen novel Emma in 2020.</p><p>As Harriet, Goth had to navigate the inner workings of a young woman constantly blinded by unattainable love before finding happiness.</p><p>Spurred on by Any Taylor-Joy’s Emma, Harriet constantly tries to impress every man she comes across, believing she must marry above her stature to be accepted into the English upper-class.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Her Turbulent Relationship With Shia LaBeouf</strong></h2><p>Goth first met Holes and Peanut Butter Falcon star Shia LaBeouf on the set of Nymphomaniac in 2013.</p><p>The two had a rocky start, from LaBeouf’s public outbursts to a <a href=#>public altercation</a> in Germany in 2015.</p><p>The pair were recorded arguing on the streets of Tübingen when locals decided to intervene in case things turned violent.</p><p><strong>“I don’t want to touch a woman, I don’t want to hit a woman, but I’m being pushed,” </strong>LaBeouf insisted before accepting a ride from German locals to the airport.</p><p>He approached Goth and asked for his backpack, telling her: <strong>“I don’t wanna touch you. I don’t wanna be aggressive. This is the kind of s— that makes a person abusive.”</strong></p><p>The most shocking part of the recorded footage was LaBeouf’s admission that he may have killed Goth had locals not intervened.</p><p>He was reportedly visiting Goth during the filming of A Cure for Wellness when the two engaged in the public brawl.&nbsp;</p><p>Three years later, media outlets reported that the two had married in an Elvis-themed ceremony in Las Vegas.</p><p>LaBeouf addressed the wedding in an <a href=#>interview</a>, saying, <strong>“we’re proud of it. It was love.”</strong></p><p>He and Goth had planned on keeping the marriage a secret; however, a secret recording of the ceremony quickly circulated around the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the pair had no idea the ceremony was being filmed, LaBeouf said it was <strong>“kind of nice”</strong> that their families could watch the video and feel they were present.</p><p>After the actor’s interview, Clark County of Nevada issued a statement claiming the couple had not gotten legally married in Las Vegas.</p><p>The Tweet <a href=#>stated</a>:</p><p><strong>“Our records show no marriage license for Shia LaBeouf [and] Mia Goth. A commitment ceremony was performed #Vegas.”</strong></p><p>Regardless of the circumstances under which they declared themselves a married couple, it seemed like the marriage between Mia Goth and Shia LaBeouf was not built to last.</p><p>They split in 2018, and a representative stated that:</p><p><strong>“Shia and Mia have filed for divorce. The separation is amicable and all details pertaining to the divorce proceedings will remain private.”</strong></p><p>No stranger to scandal, LaBeouf has been caught in a lawsuit filed by ex-girlfriend FKA Twigs on December 2020, accusing him of s*xua battery, assault, and infliction of emotional distress.&nbsp;</p><p>He and Goth reportedly reconciled in 2020, and photos of the couple taken in January 2022 show a visibly pregnant Goth out and about with LaBeouf.</p><p>The two had begun wearing rings since the news of their reconciliation spread on social media.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5yJpkoKeknXqqv4yrnK2toqO2r7OMraZmoJ%2Bnv7C%2BjJppbWWWnrmuew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-nesmith-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Nesmith Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./malika-andrews-net-worth-wiki-bio-age-parents-boyfriend-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Malika Andrews Net Worth, Wiki, Bio, Age, Parents, Boyfriend &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
