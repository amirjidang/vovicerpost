The stunning actress has <a href=#>made a name for herself in Hollywood</a>, impressing not only with her versatility but her strong work ethic and talent for filmcraft both in front of and behind the camera. Elle is also part of a great acting dynasty, <a href=#>being the younger sister of actress Dakota Fanning</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Close Are 'The Great' Co-Stars Elle Fanning And Nicholas Hoult In Real Life">How Close Are 'The Great' Co-Stars Elle Fanning And Nicholas Hoult In Real Life</a></span></p><p>Elle has been working hard to build her career as a mature actress, having taken on a series of daring roles in recent years as she seeks to test herself as an actor. Have all these decisions resulted in big film checks, however? Read on to find out just how wealthy Elle Fanning is, how she earned her wealth, and what she likes to spend her hard-earned cash on.</p><h2 id=elle-fanning-began-her-career-early><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Elle Fanning Began Her Career Early</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Maleficent: Mistress of Evil actress has certainly had a long time to accrue her wealth. Fanning began her acting career at the tender age of two, appearing in the movie I Am Sam. A slew of movie roles followed, leading Fanning to cement her status as a child actor. Transferring into TV roles, Elle also appeared in big shows such as CSI: Miami, Judging Amy, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Truth About Dakota And Elle Fanning’s Mom, Heather Joy Arrington">The Truth About Dakota And Elle Fanning’s Mom, Heather Joy Arrington</a></span></p><h2 id=she-has-been-playing-adult-roles-for-a-long-time><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Has Been Playing Adult Roles For A Long Time</span></h2><p>Something you may not know about Elle - she is really very tall! The actress stands at an impressive 5ft 8in, and this extra height allowed her to transition into mature film roles much sooner than her peers. Before she became a teenager, she was already playing older roles. Her major break-through role came in 2008 when she starred in sci-fi movie Super 8. She was just twelve years old when the movie filmed, but her character was meant to be a teenager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-been-nominated-for-big-awards><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Has Been Nominated For Big Awards</span></h2><p>It's certainly not all about the money for Elle. She has been nominated for acting awards numerous times during her career, and was particularly excited when period comedy The Great received three nominations at the Golden Globes. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Describing her excitement on discovering the news, Elle said:</a></p><p>"Everyone obviously shouts, ‘Huzzah!’ because that’s what our show does,” Fanning said, talking about a catchphrase used in the first season of the series. “I’m really so excited. I can’t stop smiling. This role, Catherine, is so special, and what Tony’s written and the gift that he’s given me in letting me play her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elle-fanning-has-aspirations-beyond-acting><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Elle Fanning Has Aspirations Beyond Acting</span></h2><p>Though Elle loves acting, she definitely has dreams which go beyond performing in front of the camera - she'd like to be behind it!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with The Hot Corn, Elle had this to say about her possible back-up profession:</a></p><p><strong>"</strong>I’d probably just do something else in the profession you know. I want to direct, I’m starting to produce. I’ve produced things now. I want to get a little bit more behind the scenes. Because when you grow up as a young actor, you’re also watching the mechanics of the films that work. And it’s like, I’ve seen that my whole life and I’m so curious about the inner workings of it and I always try to talk to the crew, I get involved and I really enjoy that. I would like to pull the curtain back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Real Reason Elle Fanning Wouldn’t Watch Dakota’s Episode Of ‘Friends’">The Real Reason Elle Fanning Wouldn’t Watch Dakota’s Episode Of ‘Friends’</a></span></p><h2 id=so-how-much-is-elle-fanning-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>So How Much Is Elle Fanning Worth?</span></h2><p>You may be surprised to hear how much Elle is worth. Despite working for over twenty years and starring in a number of big releases, Elle has a rather modest personal fortune compared to other big movie stars. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Fanning is worth around $6m. Fanning is able to command middling sums for her roles in movies; for appearing in<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Super 8, for example, she reportedly earned an impressive $1.5m.</a></p><h2 id=elle-fanning-is-worth-a-lot-less-than-her-big-sister-dakota><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Elle Fanning Is Worth A Lot Less Than Her Big Sister Dakota</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elle still has far to go if she hopes to catch up with her older sister, Dakota, who has a reported net worth which is double Elle's; a staggering $12m. In addition to acting work, Dakota also has a very lucrative career in modeling, having represented big brands all across the world, including Chanel. Dakota's additional years on her sister may also account for some of her extra earnings.</p><h2 id=the-fanning-sisters-own-property-together><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Fanning Sisters Own Property Together</span></h2><p>Elle and her big sister reportedly pooled funds back in 2019 to purchase a property together in the Toluca Lake area of Los Angeles for a whopping $2.95 million. Their house is apparently very similar to one the siblings bought together previously, with its own pool and large grounds. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Strangely, in 2020, Elle and Dakota put their new property on the market for $2.7 million, meaning they would have made a significant loss.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Dakota And Elle Fanning Reveal Their Parents Didn't Want Them To Become Actors">Dakota And Elle Fanning Reveal Their Parents Didn't Want Them To Become Actors</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecSlo55llpa7r7XNoGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkoKGioXqnvs6mZKmkkZ67t7XLpZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-blair-dewane-die-blair-dewane-cause-of-death-las-vegas-music-fixture-blair-dewane-passed-away-421381-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How did Blair Dewane die?
