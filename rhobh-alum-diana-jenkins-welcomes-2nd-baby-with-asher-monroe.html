Welcome to the world beautiful Elodie! Can’t wait to meet you! Sending lots of love to everyone! 💕💕💕.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> also chimed in, writing that she “can’t wait to meet” the couple’s little “angel.”</p><p>Jenkins <a href=#>confirmed her pregnancy</a> in December 2022, one month before announcing that she was<a href=#> exiting RHOBH</a> after only one season.</p><p>“Hi everybody … As so many of you know, Asher and I are expecting our second child later this year,” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in January. “You also know that due to many factors, this pregnancy is considered high risk and I am on doctor-advised bed rest. To that end, I am not able to devote myself fully to filming the next season of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. I would like to thank Bravo and Evolution for allowing me to focus on my pregnancy, and for their support and understanding. I promise to continue sharing my fertility journey with you.”</p><p>During a June 2022 episode of RHOBH, Jenkins revealed&nbsp;that she <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage</a> six months after welcoming daughter Eliyanah in 2020.</p><p>Jenkins and Monroe — who are engaged — met in March 2010 at a <a href=#>Victoria’s Secret fashion show</a>. Although the two didn’t begin dating until a couple years later, they cofounded the independent record label D Empire Entertainment in 2012.</p><p>Nearly eight years later, the lovebirds welcomed their first child together, daughter Eliyanah. “Thank you 2020 😊Happy New Year everyone 🎊🎈 🎉,” the entrepreneur captioned an Instagram video of Monroe and their newborn.</p><p>In 2021, Monroe&nbsp;shared some insight into his relationship with Jenkins and how she has supported his career.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Diana] has stood by my side through thick and thin,” he gushed to Pop Hearts TV at the time. “Without her, I would not be the man I am today. I have always looked up to her in the way she runs her life. Being a role model, war survivor, philanthropist, mother, entrepreneur and so much more. It’s hard to scratch the surface on the impact she has had on me forever.”</p><p>Prior to her relationship with Monroe, Diana was married to <strong>Roger Jenkins</strong> from 1999 to 2011. The twosome share son Innis, 22, and daughter Eneya, 19. Although the former couple split in 2011, they have remained on amicable terms.</p><p>“Will she take half my money? Of course. Without her, I would not have anything like the success I’ve had,” the banker previously told the Daily Mail about their divorce. “I love Diana and have such admiration for her as a mother, businesswoman and someone who was brilliant as a wife. We have moved on and are extremely happy with the arrangements we have in our lives. Diana will always be a very happy part of my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaroJ%2BXtW6ty66kZpyZlruiecmepaShnqh6uLHLnKamnaNif6%2BwjJuYm7FdrLa1tIyaqqGdomK6sLrRqJxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./revelations-about-pete-davidson-emily-ratajkowski-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Revelations About Pete Davidson &amp;amp; Emily Ratajkowski's New Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yuri-lamasbella-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-650388-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yuri Lamasbella Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
