This will mark Robinson’s fourth AEW match after he worked two bouts in 2022 and recently re-emerged on an episode of Dark.</p><p>As previously announced, Ruby Soho and Willow Nightingale will join forces again to take on their rivals Tay Melo and Anna Jay in a Street Fight. Plus, Eddie Kingston and Ortiz will take on The House of Black’s Malakai Black and Brody King.</p><p>Elsewhere, AEW World Tag Team Champions The Acclaimed are confirmed to appear, and they teased that they’re going to get stars on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood.</p><p>The results are as follows:</p><p>In a surprisingly short match, Allin was able to retain his title in a tough bout against Robinson. Late in the match, Robinson was able to avoid a Coffin Drop that would have ended things, but Allin didn’t let it deter him.</p><p>After taking a jackhammer and kicking out, Allin then hit a huge scorpion death drop, before finally hitting the Coffin Drop for the pin and win. After the match, Sting came out to celebrate with his protege.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>What a counter into the Scorpion Death Drop followed by the Coffin Drop by TNT Champion <a href=#>@DarbyAllin</a> to retain the title here on <a href=#>#AEWRampage</a> on TNT! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UNPVtULaje</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#TheGunns</a> <a href=#>@theaustingunn</a> <a href=#>@coltengunn</a> are cemented in history by <a href=#>#AEW</a> World Tag Team Champions <a href=#>#TheAcclaimed</a> <a href=#>@PlatinumMax</a> <a href=#>@Bowens_Official</a> <a href=#>@RealBillyGunn</a></p><p>Watch <a href=#>#AEWRampage</a> on TNT! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DQC7MSzDMf</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></p><p>Early on in the match, it looked like Ortiz and Kingston would fall fairly easily. However, the duo eventually fought themselves back into the match, and nearly came away with a big win late. However, in the end it was the Kings of the Black Throne utilizing some late inteference to walk out with a win.</p><p>Late in the match, Julia Hart came up from behind Eddie Kingston and began pretending that he was going to hit her with a chair, which Kingston had on him. Ortiz saw this late, and then began arguing with Kingston about why he would be attacking Hart. With the two fighting, this allowed their opponents to take advantage, knocking down Kingston with a huge kick for the win.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>What a WILD ending, as <a href=#>@snm_buddy</a> and <a href=#>@thejuliahart</a> intervene to cause utter chaos, granting <a href=#>@malakaiblxck</a> & <a href=#>@brodyxking</a> the victory tonight on <a href=#>#AEWRampage</a> on TNT! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CgmOycLV0n</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></p><p>Inside of the ring, Golden Globe award winner Paul Walter Hauser is being interviewed by Renee Paquette. Hauser said he loves professional wrestling, and now loves checking out AEW, because you never know what will happen. It was then that Danhausen interrupted the pair, coming down to the ring and demanding Hauser hand over his Golden Globe award.</p><p>As Hauser seemed open to the idea, Jeff Jarrett and his crew came down to the ring to interrupt things. Hauser then began insulting Jarrett, mocking his look, and after Sonjay Dutt put his hands on him to stop him, Hauser shocked the AEW world by punching the superstar. Jay Lethal then got his own sucker punch in on Hauser, kickstarting a huge brawl that ended in Jarrett smashing a guitar over Hauser’s head and forcing Orange Cassidy and the Best Friends to come out for the save, with Lethal stealing Hauser’s Golden Globe in the process.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Paul Walter Hauser’s Golden Globe celebration with <a href=#>@ReneePaquette</a> gets crashed! ??<a href=#>@DanhausenAD</a> <a href=#>@RealJeffJarrett</a> <a href=#>@TheLethalJay</a> <a href=#>@hellosatnam</a> <a href=#>@sonjaydutterson</a> <a href=#>@orangecassidy</a> <a href=#>@trentylocks</a> <a href=#>@SexyChuckieT</a><a href=#>#AEWRampage</a> is on TNT! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tB1FaPiRVa</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></p><p>In the final match of the night, it was a brutal Street Fight between both teams. In the end, however, it was Soho and Nightingale that did enough to come out on top. Late in the match, after Melo brought in some thumbtacks to the ring, Ruby was able to stop a piledriver attempt that would’ve sent her into it.</p><p>Instead, Soho was able to grab a handful of thumbtacks and shockingly throw them into Melo’s face. In the chaos following that, a bloodied Soho then hit her finisher on Melo onto the pile of thumbtacks, ending the match in a pinfall.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gotch Style Piledriver through the table by <a href=#>@TayMelo</a>!<br>Watch <a href=#>#AEWRampage</a> on TNT! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ldDsa5id0R</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Destination Unknown into the tacks and <a href=#>@realrubysoho</a> and <a href=#>@willowwrestles</a> are victorious tonight on <a href=#>#AEWRampage</a> on TNT! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UtWqugeLny</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJscGxpYmKupsOMq5imqJGcsm6%2BxKyspayjYn5ufZJmaWxllJa%2Fo8WMmqOloZ5iwaK3xKxkqKZdn8Kqr8RmqaiamaPAsLo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alabama-gypsy-rose-jennings-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-283541-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alabama Gypsy Rose Jennings Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, B</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-sitcoms-of-the-2000s-no-one-likes-anymore.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Sitcoms Of The 2000s No One Likes Anymore</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
