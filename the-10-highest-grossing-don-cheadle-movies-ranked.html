His character, James Rhodes, is a military officer who also operates the War Machine armor, after which he is nicknamed. In the 2019 Avengers: Endgame film, he helps Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) to stop Thanos (<a href=#>Josh Brolin</a>) from destroying half of the life in the entire Universe.

Stark and Bruce Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) now have the scepter and find a piece of artificial intelligence inside the gem of the scepter that can be used to complete Stark's "Ultron" global defense program.

The film again follows Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) who has recently gotten off a victory the previous year after he saved <a href=#>New York City</a> from an alien invasion. As a result of the Battle of New York, he has been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder causing him frequent panic attacks. To cope, he builds dozens of new Iron Man suits, which offsets his relationship with his girlfriend, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow). After being rejected by Stark to be in his company, Aldrich Killian (<a href=#>Guy Pearce</a>) goes after his girlfriend, Potts, and President Ellis, Rhodes (Don Cheadle) joins forces with him to stop Killian's reign of terror.</p><h2></h2><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Captain America's Fortune: How Chris Evans Soared To The Top</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=captain-america-civil-war>Captain America: Civil War</h2><p>In one of the most epic franchises of the Marvel Studios film productions, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Captain America: Civil War</a> explains the combative division between Steve Rogers/Captain America (<a href=#>Chris Evans</a>) and Tony Stark after a building of Wakandan humanitarian workers were killed in Lagos, Nigeria while attempting to stop Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) from stealing a biological weapon from a lab. In response to the accidental deaths, U.S Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), passes the Sokavia Records, which will cause the UN to oversee The Avengers. Tony Stark supports the idea of being overseen, while Rogers prefers to work independently from the UN, which drives a rift between the two. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) also arrests Stark, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), T'Challa (<a href=#>Chadwick Boseman</a>), and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) after T'Challa vows to kill Barnes for blowing up his father, T'Chaka (John Kani).

It follows the main star of the entire franchise, Tony Stark (Robert Donwey Jr.) who has recently revealed to the world his identity as Iron Man. He is quickly becoming a media superstar and it has attracted the attention of Ivan Vanko (<a href=#>Mickey Rourke</a>), also known as Whiplash, who begins building his own arc reactor similar to Stark's. Stark also learns that the palladium core in the arc reactor that powers his suit is slowly poisoning him. While competing in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, Stark is attacked by Vanko in the middle of the race and seriously damages the Iron Man suit. Justin Hammer <a href=#>(Sam Rockwell)</a> is impressed by Vanko and fakes his death so he can replicate Stark's suits. Then Stark and James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) get into a suit-fighting showdown after Stark becomes drunk at a house party. After their brief rivalry, Rhodes and Stark work together to defeat Hammer and Vanko.

Released in 2001, the film follows Danny Ocean (<a href=#>George Clooney</a>) who has recently been released from prison and immediately goes to see his partner-in-crime, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt). The career criminals plan a heist and now want to propose their plan to a former casino owner, Rueben Tishkoff (ElliotnGould). The elaborate plan involves simultaneously robbing the MGM Grand, the Bellagio, and the Mirage casinos, the largest score being the vault in the Bellagio, which would have a vault containing $150,000,000 on the night of a boxing match. To assist in their master plan, they recruit other master criminals, namely Linus Caldwell (<a href=#>Matt Damon</a>); Frank Catton (Bernie Mac); Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk Malloy (Scott Caan); Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison); Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle); Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner), and "The Amazing" Yen (Shaobo Qin).

The only problem was that Terry Benedict (<a href=#>Andy Garcia</a>), the owner of all three casinos they stole from (and the boyfriend of Danny's ex-wife, Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts)) is demanding all the money to be returned, with $38 million interest. Realizing they don't have half of what Benedict is asking, they plan a heist in London but are beat to it by another master thief called François Toulour/The Night Fox (Vincent Cassel). Rusty's old girlfriend, Isabel Lahiri (<a href=#>Catherin Zeta-Jones</a>) is a detective and is on to both Danny and his crew as well as The Night Fox. The sequel was great but didn't earn as much as the original film, grossing $362.9 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rush-hour-2>Rush Hour 2</h2><p>Where did Chris Tucker go?
