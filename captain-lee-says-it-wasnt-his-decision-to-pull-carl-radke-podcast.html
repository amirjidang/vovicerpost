I think the fans heard because I’ve had some people questioning me about, ‘OK, we heard the tease. Where is it?'” the <a href=#>Below Deck</a> alum, 73, said on the Wednesday, November 15, episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>his “Salty With Captain Lee” podcast</a>. “I’m sorry to inform you that it will not be aired and that was not my call.”</p><p>Lee made it clear that he didn’t have all the answers about the decision.</p><p>“If you would like to find out why, I guess you could ask Carl Radke,” he added. “We did do it. We did record it but it will not be played. So I apologize to all of you who thought you were going to be hearing it. That was my intention but things just didn’t work out.”</p><p>According to Lee, the episode was scrapped at the very last moment. “That’s why we didn’t have a show last week. We were ready to air and the plug got pulled. But not by us. Make of that what you will,” he concluded.</p><p>Us Weekly released an <a href=#>exclusive sneak peek of the planned tell-all one day before</a> the podcast was scheduled to go live. In the two separate clips, Radke, 38, explained why he didn’t regret ending his engagement to <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong></a>.</p><p>“It’s been scary. It’s been confusing. It’s been emotional. And I feel really bad with how everything ultimately played out,” Radke said in the first audio, which was posted on November 6. “If I could go back and make something a little bit easier or better, I would.”</p><p>Radke maintained that he stood by the breakup, adding, “I do firmly think Lindsay and I going in separate directions will be healthier for us in the long run.”</p><p><a href=#>Summer House</a> viewers watched Radke and Hubbard, 37, get engaged in season 7 after one year of dating. They<a href=#> were expected to tie the knot in Mexico</a> this month before news broke that Radke<a href=#> ended their engagement three months before</a> their nuptials.</p><p>Radke noted in a second clip from Lee’s unaired podcast that season 8 of Summer House will show what led to the split. “Due to the fact that our show is gonna air in January, I do really think people are gonna watch this season and a lot of questions might be answered,” he explained. “People really understand how a decision like calling off a wedding [how it] could come to that. It’s a very big thing.”</p><p>Radke added: “It’s been a very painful, emotional time. So I’ve been silent trying to just process, be respectful, try to move forward and heal properly. It’s been just a difficult situation.”</p><p>Hubbard has publicly alleged Radke <a href=#>“completely blindsided” her with the situation.</a></p><p>“It was absolutely humiliating. It would’ve been one thing if this conversation happened over the summer during the normal filming schedule,” she exclusively revealed in a November issue of Us. “But for [Carl] to call up producers and then set up cameras and manipulate me into sitting down [so he could break up with me] after we’d already wrapped is scary. The whole world found out within 30 minutes of me.”</p><p>Radke denied her version of events regarding producers during various interviews at <a href=#>BravoCon</a>. Hubbard, meanwhile, questioned Radke’s claims that they were going through major issues before the split.</p><p>“I don’t like this narrative that we fought all summer. We did not fight all summer — at all,” she, told Us at BravoCon on November 4. “That’s why it was an ultimate blindsiding, because we had a couple of arguments in the beginning. Normal couples [have] arguments.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hubbard recalled having “great summer” <a href=#>before the “last couple of weeks” changed everything.</a></p><p>“It was like, ‘What is happening right now?’ So, this whole idea that it was like we had a rough summer [is wrong]. This was the best summer,” she added at the time. “It was the most fun summer in the last couple of years of Summer House. Even <a href=#><strong>Kyle [Cooke]</strong></a> agrees! Everyone agrees with that. All the girls, everyone. I don’t like this narrative that this was a rough summer, because it was not.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaCprqq6jKWcnmWjlsa0ecitZLCZo6PBbrTIrGSdnZOewKq7zWarqGWgqrmtecKaqaVlopaxrLGMqaadm5GowXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-cornell-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Cornell Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brandel-chamblee-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brandel Chamblee Wife Stylish &amp;amp; Elegant Partner Of Champion</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
