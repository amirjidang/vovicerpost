Years ago, we used to be forced to watch a show depicting various species of animals living in the natural environment and listen to some English guy tell us what they were and what they were doing. Then everything changed. Suddenly this was no longer the way to learn about nature. The viewing public wanted something more intense and much more entertaining.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This brought about the genre of television known as Outdoor/Adventure TV. These are shows that educate the public on various aspects of the outdoors, while still maintaining a high level of excitement. The hosts of these programs are normally some of the most memorable characters on TV.</p><p>Whether they are out hunting, traveling, fishing, or simply surviving the elements, we always find ourselves watching and wishing we could do something like that. These shows tend to capture our imagination and instill a new level of respect for Mother Nature that we did not have prior to viewing. For these skills and ratings, television channels are willing to pay these hosts a pretty penny. Many of these people just started out doing something they loved. Then all of a sudden, they were millionaires. More than likely they would have done this stuff for free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-jeremy-wade----net-worth-1-5-million><b>10.
