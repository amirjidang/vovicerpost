I started @HelloSunshine to change the way all women are seen in media. Over the past few years, we have watched our mission thrive through books, TV, film and social platforms,” Witherspoon, 45, <a href=#>announced via Instagram</a> on Monday, August 2. “Today, we’re taking a huge step forward by partnering with @blackstone, which will enable us to tell even more entertaining, impactful and illuminating stories about women’s lives globally. I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for our future.”</p><p>The actress, who created the company in 2016, described her plans to <a href=#>keep offering unique storytelling through multiple media platforms</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reese-Witherspoon-Sells-Her-Production-Company-Hello-Sunshine.jpg><p>“I am committed to continuing to create opportunity for filmmakers, authors and creators of all backgrounds and experiences to tell their stories in their own way, and reach more audiences who will see that their stories matter,” the Legally Blonde star added. “This is a unique time in our world where the intersection of art, commerce and media makes it possible for these creators to tell their stories and Hello Sunshine is here to put a spotlight on their amazing creations.”</p><p>The company, whose mission has been to “empower women and the people who celebrate them,” will continue to include Witherspoon in the day-to-day operations, according to <a href=#>a&nbsp;press release from Blackstone</a>. Former Disney executives <strong>Kevin Mayer</strong> and <strong>Tom Staggs</strong> will be joining the team to help run the new business venture.</p><p>“We are thrilled to partner with Reese, Sarah, and the entire Hello Sunshine team. Hello Sunshine is a perfect fit for our vision of a new, next generation entertainment, technology, and commerce company,” Mayer and Staggs said in the statement. “We seek to empower creators with innovation, capital, and scale to inspire, entertain, and delight global audiences with engaging content, experiences, and products. Our platform will foster a uniquely creator-friendly culture that gives elite talent the resources they need to create and capitalize on their best, most inventive work. We look forward to backing Reese, Sarah, and their world-class team as they continue to produce and identify dynamic, engaging content for years to come.”</p><p>The Morning Show actress <a href=#>previously opened up about how the production company allowed her to “change things” in the entertainment industry</a>.</p><p>“I see younger women in our industry and I want them to have a better experience,” <a href=#>the Whiskey in a Teacup author explained</a> to CBS This Morning in May 2020. “I want to see that they have a beautiful idea of what the future could hold.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since its conception, Hello Sunshine has produced projects, including Gone Girl, <a href=#>Big Little Lies</a>, <a href=#>Little Fires Everywhere</a> and Wild. For Witherspoon, the hard work that she put in was worth it for the progress that paved the way for future storytellers.</p><p>“I will put in the hours and I bet on myself. I’m my own lottery ticket. I always think that, you know. If no one else shows up, I know I will show up and I know I will do the work,” she said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmenaOaeri106Gcq6ugpLyvedKeo6WrXaW%2FsLDUnKuip55isLC5z5qlsmWWpL9uhY9pZKahnKG2sLqO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rosa-salazar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rosa Salazar Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1199016-randy-orton-wants-to-face-the-fiend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Randy Orton: If The Fiend Has A Bone To Pick With Anybody, Its The Legend Killer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
