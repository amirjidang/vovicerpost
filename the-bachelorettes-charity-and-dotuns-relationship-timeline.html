So leading up to those moments, a lot of things were at play, different things were moving and shifting every single day.”</p><p class=p1>While Charity was previously torn between Dotun and Joey, she ultimately sent <a href=#>the tennis pro</a> home on proposal day. Dotun went on to <a href=#>pop the question with a Neil Lane sparkler</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Charity, you’ve inspired me. You’ve shown me that a good thing can really just be a good thing,” Dotun gushed during his televised proposal in Fiji. “The love that we have is perfect. And so, Miss Charity Lawson, <a href=#>would you do me the honor</a> of turning this fairy tale into a reality?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bachelorette-Charity-Lawson-and-Fiance-Dotun-Olubeko-Relationship-Timeline-1.jpg><p class=p1>Charity accepted Dotun’s proposal — and gave him the final rose. Keep reading for the pair’s full relationship timeline:</p><h3><b>Out of the Limo, Into the Bachelor Mansion</b></h3><p class=p1>New York-based Dotun was <a href=#>one of Charity’s suitors</a> on season 20 of <i>The Bachelorette</i>. They formed an immediate connection after he shared his immigration story.</p><h3><b>Back-to-Back Dates</b></h3><p class=p1>Dotun was the only <i>Bachelorette </i>season 20 contestant to receive two one-on-one dates — in successive weeks. One week after they bungee-jumped in Stevenson, Washington, Charity invited Dotun to run a marathon with her in New Orleans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bachelorette-Charity-Lawson-and-Fiance-Dotun-Olubeko-Relationship-Timeline-4.jpg><p class=p1>Charity later told <i>Us </i>in August 2023 that their <a href=#>first date was “life-changing.”</a> She added: “Along the journey has been beautiful, but I made [my final] decision at his last chance date.”</p><h3><b>Hometown Sweeties</b></h3><p class=p1>Dotun was initially disheartened that his parents were unavailable to <a href=#>attend his hometown date</a> due to their previously scheduled vacation to Nigeria. Charity was set to meet her man’s siblings and grandmother before her future in-laws made a surprise appearance. Dotun’s mom even proclaimed that if the consultant was Charity’s choice, she would host <a href=#>an elaborate Nigerian wedding</a>.</p><p class=p1>Dotun and Charity’s<a href=#> families met for the first time in person</a> — after “lots of FaceTimes” — during <a href=#><i>After The Final Rose </i></a>in August 2023.</p><p class=p1>“They love each other! It’s been so fun,” the child and family therapist gushed to <i>Us</i>. “They’re just cutting up together, which is what we imagine would happen. .. He’s become so close with my brother as I imagined would happen. We’re obviously excited for the future and can’t get over this whole engagement and what’s to come.”</p><h3><b>Soulmate Vibes</b></h3><p class=p1>During Dotun’s final date in Fiji, he presented Charity with a “scavenger hunt” of their <i>Bachelorette </i>journey. The hunt concluded with a locket that had each of their baby photos inside.</p><h3><b>She Said Yes!</b></h3><p class=p1>After Dotun proposed, Charity <a href=#>gave him her final rose</a>. “You have made me feel alive. You’ve made me believe in love again. You’ve made me feel so valued and so seen,” she said during the episode. “And so, Dotun, when I stand here in this moment, I want a forever future with you. I see you as my husband. I see you as my future. I see it so clearly. I don’t have any doubts. I don’t question it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bachelorette-Charity-Lawson-and-Fiance-Dotun-Olubeko-Relationship-Timeline-2.jpg><h3><b>August 2023</b></h3><p class=p1>During the couple’s appearance on <i>After the Final Rose</i>, Dotun informed Charity that <a href=#>she was joining the cast of <i>Dancing With the Stars </i></a>season 32.</p><p class=p1>“We both talked about it and it’s something that I didn’t really know was going to truly happen, but he, obviously, is so supportive of it, which I admire,” she told <i>Us</i>, noting Dotun would be relocating to California during <a href=#>the dance competition</a>. “And he’s my biggest fan, which is great to have that. … We’ll be doing it together. He just won’t be the one dancing. I’ll be up there, [but] he’ll be along.”</p><p class=p1>Charity added that Dotun will “always be my priority” throughout <a href=#>her stint in the ballroom</a>.</p><h3 class=p1><b>October 2023</b></h3><p class=p2>Dotun has been Charity’s No. 1 cheerleader in the <i>DWTS </i>ballroom, which she’s noticed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p2>“I wanted to give Dotun his flowers … because, truly, your support in this season alone has been insane, but ever since the moment you stepped into my life, it has changed for the better,” Charity gushed via Instagram Story after the pair got home from “Most Memorable Year” night, in which <a href=#>she earned the first 10 of the season</a>. “And so, I just want to thank you for pushing me.”</p><p class=p2>She added: “Little fact, right before I went on, Dotun went up to me and he told me to, ‘Leave it all out on the floor.’ So it was a really special moment and definitely got my wheels turning for [expressing] all of the emotions.
