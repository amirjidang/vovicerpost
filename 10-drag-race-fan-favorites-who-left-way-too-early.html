Going on for almost a decade and a half now, the show remains one of the most beloved shows on TV, <a href=#>with celebrities also becoming fans</a>.</p><p>So with several spin-offs, <a href=#>monumental awards received</a> and cash prizes that keep going up with every season, some drag queens of Rupaul's Drag Race (now turned global sensations), managed to win over fans' love during the show. They might have sashayed away early from the show, but they shantay-ed their way into fans' hearts with their finesse, quirks, and incomparable shticks. So keep scrolling to find out who these fan-favorites are.</p><h2 id=shangela><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Shangela</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shangela came on to RuPaul's Drag Race as a baby drag queen who lacked the experience and oomph to stand out as a fierce queen. She was the first queen to be eliminated in season 2 but came back for a do-over in season 3 and All Stars 3. Even though she was nowhere close to the crown, her "hallelu" catchphrase and humor skyrocketed her career, launching her into Hollywood appearing in A Star is Born, alongside Lady Gaga and HBO's We're Here. So we can say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has been doing extremely well since the show</a>.</p><h2 id=eureka><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Eureka</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Big girl Eureka O'Hara was a force on the show and brought it every single time to the runway. After being removed from season 9 due to an injury suffered, she returned to compete in season 10 and came out as runner-up. Eureka also competed on All Stars 6 placing as second runner-up. Just like Shangela, Eureka is a co-host for HBO'S We're Here, alongside Bob the Drag Queen. She is loud, proud and holds nothing back.</p><h2 id=bendelacreme><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>BenDeLaCreme</span></h2><p>BenDeLaCreme brought quirks and humor when she appeared on season 6 of the show. Fans must have loved her so much, as she won season 6 Miss Congeniality. After a drag hiatus, when she came back in All Stars 3, it was like she never left. After a fantastical 5 challenge wins, she exited the show on her own terms, feeling she had having already proven herself, with the other contestants wanting the crown more than she did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=plastique-tiara><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Plastique Tiara</span></h2><p>Plastique Tiara is the drag daughter of Alyssa Edwards. She dazzled viewers with her sickening body, gorgeous face and over-the-top drag style, for someone who was just 21 years old when she appeared on season 11 of the show. Unfortunately, she placed 8th place in the show. However, not only did the Vietnamese beauty become one of the most followed queens on social media, she showed that she was more than a pretty face and had the star-factor fans were drawn to.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 8 Most Iconic Runway Looks From ‘Rupaul’s Drag Race</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=valentina><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Valentina</span></h2><p>Just like Plastique, Valentina was one of the most gorgeous queens to grace the show. She appeared in season 9 where after a failed and very embarrassing lip-sync for your life battle, she lost to Nina Bo'Nina Brown. On the flip side, she won Miss Congeniality that season, but was questioned whether she was deserving of it. The star came back in All Stars 4, and she shined all the way, redeeming her image and her lip sync prowess.</p><h2 id=katya><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Katya</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katya's personality stole the show when she appeared in season 7. Her Russian and outright outrageous gimmick got fans' attention. She placed fifth, even though fans wanted her to go all the way, but then won Miss Congeniality. When she came back for All Stars 2, she placed in as runner-up. Now, Katya is conquering the drag and comedy world with Trixie Mattel.</p><h2 id=monet-x-change><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Monet X Change</span></h2><p>Monet has been nothing short of entertaining on the show. From her unforgettable Nicki Minaj's "Pound The Alarm" lip-sync to her sponge outfit which fans weirdly loved, she won season 10 Miss Congeniality after placing sixth and went ahead to win All Stars 3 alongside Trinity the Tuck. She's now on All Stars 7, and is showing so many talented layers of her drag range, and fans are rooting for her more than ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Who Is The Richest Queen On 'RuPaul’s Drag Race' All Stars 7?</a></span></p><h2 id=miss-vanjie><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Miss Vanjie</span></h2><p>Apart from being the drag daughter of Alexis Mateo, Vanjie gave us an iconic exit in the first episode of season 10 when she parted with famous words, "Miss Vanjie." With her fame, she found her way to season 11 and finished in fifth place. Vanjie is one of the most popular queens from the RuPaul's Drag Race franchise and fans are hoping to see her compete again.</p><h2 id=alyssa-edwards><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Alyssa Edwards</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alyssa Edwards has done it all. Having conquered the pageant, dancing, business, and reality world, she never got around to snatching the crown in RuPaul's Drag Race. However, her impact is undeniable. She competed in season 5 of the show finishing in 6th place, and also appeared in All Stars 2. The successful queen starred in her own web series Alyssa's Secret and Dancing Queen on Netflix.</p><h2 id=trixie-mattel><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Trixie Mattel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Trixie Mattel has managed to birth a loud, bold, exaggerated and tune-high standout drag style that makes it almost impossible for one to look away from. Although Trixie competed in season 7 of the show and placed in 6th place, she went on to win All Stars 3. <a href=#>Since winning All Stars 3</a>, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most famous drag queen to emerge from the RuPaul franchise</a> does not appear to be pumping the brakes anytime soon with several moneymaking ventures like singing, Judging Queen of the Universe, Trixie cosmetics, podcasts, books, and tours with fellow drag queen Katya.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Drag Queens That Found Fame After Being On RuPaul’s Drag Race</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWUp66oedGamp5llpa7brLAr6aroaSawG7Dx6hkpZ2WqXq4rdhmq6inXZqus7jYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-mark-leiter-and-al-leiter-related-know-about-the-baseball-players-family-tree-416491-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are Mark Leiter And Al Leiter Related?
