Their wedding was a Hollywood affair and one of the most talked about ones in the celebrity world that year. It even brought Brad Pitt’s ex Gwyneth Paltrow to tears just because she knew that she would never have a chance with him ever again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while Jen and Brad seemed very happy on the outside, something triggered Brad to stray from his marriage in 2004. That’s when he met his future wife, <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> on the set of their film, Mr. & Mrs. Smith. And the rest, as they say, is history. Brad and Jen divorced just for Brad to start his relationship with Angie. His fans had a hard time forgiving him for letting go of Jen to get with Hollywood’s ultimate home-wrecker, Angelina Jolie. But now that the couple is divorcing, everyone thinks there’s a chance that Brad might turn his wrongs into rights by not only asking Jen for forgiveness, but giving their love another shot. Hey, it’s Hollywood. Anything can happen!</p><p>With all of that being said, here are 15 signs that say Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are going to get back together. You knew that it was going to happen. We knew that it was going to happen. We’re even sure that your neighbor’s dog knew it was going to happen. Now it’s just time for it to happen already!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-both-single-at-the-same-time><strong>They Are Both Single At The Same Time</strong></h2><p>If someone were to ask you back in 2005 if you would ever imagine seeing Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together again, of course you would have one of two answers. Half of us knew that their marriage was&nbsp;over and that there was no way Jen would be able to forgive Brad for cheating on her with Angelina Jolie. But the other half would still hold on to hope. One of the reasons why Jen was dragged into the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie love triangle is because everyone knew they would eventually get back together again.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Gives Angelina Jolie $100 Million In Divorce Settlement</a></strong></p><p>And here we are, almost 13 years down the road and both Brad and Jennifer are single. They’ve also been hiding from the spotlight, which has a lot of people suspicious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-is-now-out-of-the-picture><strong>Angelina Is Now Out Of The Picture</strong></h2><p>Now that Angelina Jolie is completely out of the picture, Brad Pitt can do what he wants, say what he wants, and see whoever he wants, for that matter. Now, that’s not to say that Angie had a stronghold on him during their marriage. But she was pretty influential, especially when it came to their public image.</p><p>While there’s no doubt that Brad loves his kids, a lot of people would agree that Angie’s lifestyle just wasn’t for him. He’s a Malibu boy who would rather ride his four-wheeler at the beach and eat ice cream in bed with his wife. And those are just some of the things he did while he was with Jen. Now that Brad is free to do what he wants, will he go back to everything and everyone from his past?</p><h2 id=they-ve-always-kept-in-touch><strong>They’ve Always Kept In Touch</strong></h2><p>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston might have had a dramatic, heartbreaking divorce, but despite all of their problems, they’ve always kept in touch. The same can’t be said about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Even though they still co-parent their six kids together, their divorce has been nasty with Angie slinging mud in the press and at Brad’s direction. Jennifer never did that. She knew better than to involve the press in their messy breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Unique Parenting Rules Angelina Jolie Follows To Raise Her Kids</a></strong></p><p>Plus, both Jennifer and Brad have admitted that they’ve always had each other’s phone numbers on their speed dial. That speaks volumes about their post-divorce relationship, right? They wanted to maintain a friendship, even though they couldn’t show it. There’s no way Angie would ever allow Brad to be seen with Jen in public. But inside, they always knew they were best friends.</p><h2 id=jen-kept-his-post-it-notes><strong>Jen Kept His Post-It Notes</strong></h2><p>Just recently, there was a report that said Justin Theroux freaked out when he found old post-it notes that Brad Pitt wrote to Jennifer Aniston while they were still married. And who can blame him? Anyone in Justin’s position wouldn’t be very happy stumbling upon old love notes from an ex-husband. You would think that Jennifer would be better at hiding those kind of things, but apparently she didn’t. While a lot of exes like to keep their momentums stashed somewhere in a memory box, Jen has her stuff all out and about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Jennifer will never admit to this out loud, but Brad has always been on her mind. And he was probably even more on her mind after he and Angelina Jolie announced their separation in 2014.</p><h2 id=they-were-hollywood-s-golden-couple><strong>They Were Hollywood’s Golden Couple</strong></h2><p>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston were called Hollywood’s Golden Couple for a reason. That’s because they were in the prime of their careers. What’s more, everyone wanted to be just like them. Each and every time Brad and Jennifer hit the red carpet together, all eyes were always on them.</p><p>Brad was also concerned when he was misinterpreted in a Variety interview about quotes he made about his marriage to Jennifer. He released a statement that said, “It grieves me that this was interpreted this way. Jen is an incredibly giving, loving and hilarious woman who remains my friend. It is an important relationship I value greatly. The point I was trying to make is not that Jen was dull but that I was becoming dull to myself — and that I am responsible for.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-were-both-miserable-with-their-spouses><strong>They Were Both Miserable With Their Spouses</strong></h2><p>Both Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston left their significant others for a good reason. There’s no denying that Brad was miserable with Angelina and Jen felt the same way with her soon-to-be ex-husband Justin Theroux. For Brad, he just couldn’t handle the pressure of always trying to look perfect in front of the cameras with Angelina. Plus, the couple had six kids together. There’s no way that he was able to give them all the attention they deserved and needed, especially when he was constantly butting heads with Angie.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston's Failed Marriage Was A Hoax</a></strong></p><p>Of course, Jen and Justin didn’t have the same set of problems that Brad and Angie did, but they weren’t too far behind in their misery. Apparently, Justin grew tired of Jen’s friends. And worse, they reportedly had very little in common. A lot of people have even said they were surprised that Jen and Justin even got married in the first place!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jen-never-wanted-to-get-a-divorce><strong>Jen Never Wanted To Get A Divorce</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston never wanted to pull the plug on her marriage to Brad Pitt. That wasn’t part of the plan. But Jen had no choice but to end things, especially since she knew that Brad was having an affair with Angelina Jolie behind her back. Brad has never said it, but it was a regrettable mistake because it ruined his first marriage.</p><p>Plus, when it comes to love and marriage, Jen likes to get philosophical. She once said, “Most of us fall in love with someone's persona and spend the next three to five years discovering who that person really is. If you can stay connected through that process of raw vulnerability, I think you have a shot at the prize of knowing and accepting another human being for who and what they really are after years of highs and lows.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jen-has-always-been-brad-s-rock><strong>Jen Has Always Been Brad’s Rock</strong></h2><p>Now, no one knows if this is true, but throughout the years many reports have indicated that Jen has always been there for Brad, despite their ups and downs. She’s even admitted that they would often text each other to congratulate one another for their career accomplishments or to simply with each other a happy birthday. In other words, they’ve always kept in contact and never lost touch.</p><p>Plus, Jen and Brad have always been on the same page. Jennifer once said, “I think it's important to have closure in any relationship that ends&nbsp;– from a romantic relationship to a friendship. You should always have a sense of clarity at the end and know why it began and why it ended. You need that in your life to move cleanly into your next phase.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-she-s-a-friend-who-listens><strong>And She’s A Friend Who Listens</strong></h2><p>While there is a lot that can be said about a person like Jennifer Aniston, there’s no doubting that she’s a good friend. One of the reasons why she has so many best friends in Los Angeles is because she’s a good listener. And even though Brad Pitt completely humiliated her by dumping her for Angelina Jolie, Jen never got nasty or vindictive. Many reports indicated that Jen continued to be a good friend to Brad by offering to listen to him and his problems. I mean, how many ex-wives do you know that would do something similar? Yeah, we didn’t think so, either!</p><p>Plus, unlike Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Aniston truly values friendships. She once said in an interview, “Where would you be without friends? The people to pick you up when you need lifting? We come from homes far from perfect, so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends&nbsp;– your own chosen family. There's nothing like a really loyal, dependable, good friend. Nothing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-ve-always-had-common-interests><strong>They’ve Always Had Common Interests</strong></h2><p>Before Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s divorce, the couple spent a lot of time with each other and their friends. They’ve always had common interests. They were often spotted hanging out with their A-list friends at trendy hot spots, singing karaoke with Sting or sunbathing with their besties in Cabo. Heck, Brad Pitt even made the effort to guest star on an episode of Friends. Life was good until Angelina Jolie stepped into the picture.</p><p>Plus, Brad is no fan of the celebrity world, just like Jen Aniston. If there’s one thing they love to do, it’s stay at home. Brad has said, “It took me a good decade of hiding in my house and not going outside to even, like, get my arms around this idea of celebrity, where suddenly people are looking for you to pick your nose or get a shot of you kissing some woman. It's a very discombobulating thing.”</p><h2 id=brad-is-in-hiding><strong>Brad Is In Hiding</strong></h2><p>I’m sure that a lot of people have noticed by now that Brad Pitt has been in hiding for several long months now. A coincidence? We think not. We haven’t seen Brad out and about in a very long time. And the timing couldn’t be any more obvious. Jennifer has just announced her separation, which has some people wondering if something might be going on behind closed doors. The truth will come out soon enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, Brad isn’t one to tell the truth. He once said (and this is very telling), “How many stories have you read that aren't true, stories about me and Angie being married or fighting or splitting up? And when we don't split up, there's a whole new round that we've made up and we're back together again!”</p><h2 id=their-careers-could-use-a-boost><strong>Their Careers Could Use A Boost</strong></h2><p>Brad Pitt will always be an A-list star. Both he and Jennifer Aniston have the kind of name recognition that most other celebrities don’t have, mostly because they are always in the gossip and tabloid magazines. But with that being said, they haven’t had a hit movie in years. As a matter of fact, we can’t even remember the titles of the last movies that Brad and Jen even starred in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What’s more, Brad knows that his image and his personal life is very important to his professional one. He once said, “When you see a person, do you just concentrate on their looks? It's just a first impression. Then there's someone who doesn't catch your eye immediately, but you talk to them and they become the most beautiful thing in the world. The greatest actors aren't what you would call beautiful s*x symbols.”</p><h2 id=they-ve-always-had-mutual-respect-for-one-another><strong>They’ve Always Had Mutual Respect For One Another</strong></h2><p>While Brad and Jen did drop a little shade at each other right after their split, they’ve always had mutual respect for one another. A lot of people will say that Jennifer Aniston was the person who was done wrong in their divorce. And despite everything that she’s been through, she’s never really dragged her ex-husband under the bus. Instead, they’ve managed to keep things very civil between them. You can’t say that about every ex-couple in the celebrity world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What’s more, Jen and Brad had one last vacation as a married couple before announcing their divorce. They went to the Caribbean with their friends in 2005. They wanted to end things in the best way possible. Jennifer once put it this way: “Marriage brings up all the things I pushed to the back burner&nbsp;– the fears, the mistrust, the doubts, the insecurities. It's like opening Pandora's box.”</p><h2 id=they-were-always-meant-to-be><strong>They Were Always Meant To Be</strong></h2><p>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston will always be remembered as the golden couple of their generation. For a lot of fans, they were just perfect together. They were beautiful, rich, in love and totally smitten with one another. Their marriage was picture perfect until a certain person stepped in and wreaked havoc.</p><p>But then again, it does take two to tango, right? Brad is just as guilty here. Angelina Jolie’s fans will argue that if Brad was as happy as he looked in his marriage, then he wouldn’t have strayed. Others say that he was just weak and impressionable at the time. Whatever the case, there’s no denying that Jen will always be connected to Brad in one way or another. They were simply just meant to be with one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-want-to-give-love-a-second-try><strong>They Want To Give Love A Second Try</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it. Brad Pitt was and will always be one of the&nbsp;most handsome men in Hollywood. And Jennifer Aniston will always be America’s sweetheart, too. These two won’t be single forever. Fans have been waiting for this to happen and the timing couldn’t be any better. Plus, both have said in the past that they believe in love, so why not give their love another try? The foundation is already set for them.</p><p>Plus, Brad Pitt knew that his marriage to Angelina Jolie was&nbsp;on the decline when the two tied the knot in 2014. And making a movie together wasn’t the best idea, either: “[Shooting By The Sea] was probably not the wisest way to spend a honeymoon. But then again, fighting to make something together — what better metaphor for marriage?”</p><p>It's your move, Jen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiaopaxbrzIratmopWju6qyxKtkmqaZqMGwuoyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmmZeWtq95kWlocWWgnby1u9Jo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-stars-who-waited-until-marriage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Stars Who Waited Until Marriage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-rich-people-who-are-so-annoying-you-want-to-punch-in-the-face.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Rich People Who Are So Obnoxious You Want To Punch In The Face</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
