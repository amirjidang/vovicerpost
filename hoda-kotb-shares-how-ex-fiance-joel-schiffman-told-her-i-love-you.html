Kotb, 59, replied, “No. Neither of the times. Neither of the — whatever — three times.”</p><p>Kotb was previously married to <strong>Burzis Kanga</strong> from 2005 to 2008. She and Schiffman, 66, began dating in 2013 and got engaged six years later. Since <a href=#>calling it quits</a> in 2022 after eight years together, Kotb has been on <a href=#>several dates</a> with a new man.</p><p>“Joel said ‘I love you’ first,” she revealed. “I think I know what I feel, but I think you’re braver if you say it first. I think it shows that you can take a risk and you’re standing out there.”</p><p>Looking back on the moment, Kotb continued: “After he said it, [he said], ‘Don’t let me blow out here in the wind by myself, now.’ … And I said to him, I remember it, I said, ‘No. I just want to feel this for a second before I say something, before I respond.’ Because sometimes you’re so quick to respond, you don’t ever get to receive the thing.”</p><p>The memory was one Bush Hager, 42, found to be sweet. “Aw, it’s like a Hallmark movie,” she quipped before looking into the camera.</p><p>Kotb was quick to catch on that her cohost was referencing her role in the upcoming Hallmark Christmas movie <a href=#>Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story</a>. “Are you just referring back to that again?” she asked. Bush Hager responded by stating she was “just thinking about my trailer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Todays-Hoda-Kotb-Recalls-the-Moment-Her-Ex-Fiance-Joel-Schiffman-Told-Her-I-Love-You-2.jpg><p>Kotb first announced her and Schiffman’s split during a <a href=# rel=noopener>January 2022 episode</a> of Hoda & Jenna, saying that they were going to start the new year “on our new path as loving parents to our adorably delightful children and as friends.” (The two adopted their daughters Haley, 7, and Hope, 5, in 2017 and 2019, respectively.)</p><p>Three months later, Kotb exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that coparenting with her ex was going smoothly. “He sees the kids,” she shared in April 2022. “He takes them to school some, and he sees them on weekends. We’ve got a really nice situation. … We make sure that the kids get plenty of him and plenty of me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kotb made a <a href=#>rare comment about Schiffman</a> on a March episode of Hoda & Jenna, praising him and her exes for being “super polite” people. “Like, when I get up from the table, for instance, Joel got up every time, every time, even if it’s [a] normal dinner,” she shared.</p><p>She also recalled one time when she accidentally mistook a pair of his shoes for her own. “Joel and I had the exact same pairs of sneakers, except for different sizes, I assumed,” she explained. “And when I put on his sneaker and it fit, and he was like, ‘Where are my sneakers?’ I got, ‘I don’t know,’ [and] he goes, ‘They were right here!’ … It was sad! I go, ‘Those are your sneakers?’ He goes, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘Oh, my God, that is sad!’”</p><p>The Today anchor <a href=#>paid tribute to Schiffman</a> on Father’s Day last month by sharing an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram pic</a> of him and their girls cuddling up together on a couch. “Happy father’s day to the best dad!” she captioned the June 16 post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp5SWeqy705tkrKCRp7K0eceormadqGKzqq3NnJxmop%2BauW6%2FwqGgn56dlrtuwM6lm2aglad6qnnLqK2eZamkwnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./horatio-sanz-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-106721-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Horatio Sanz Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./high-school-student-fort-lauderdale-dies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>High School Student Fort Lauderdale Dies After Jumping From Building</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
