McGowan alleged she was raped by Weinstein in a hotel while at the Sundance Film Festival. She was offered money to remain silent about the misconduct, but she refused and has continued to not only criticize Weinstein, but speak out about the pervasive problem in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kesha><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kesha</span></h2><p>The singer known for hits like "Tik Tok" and"Timber," <a href=#>Kesha</a> has been embroiled in a lawsuit for years now. <a href=#>In 2014 she filed a lawsuit</a> looking to void her contract with Dr. Luke, music producer and then-CEO of record label Kemosabe/RCA, for&nbsp;a litany of&nbsp;reasons like&nbsp;sexual assault, civil harassment, and infliction of emotional distress. Kesha said&nbsp;the lawsuit was <a href=#>"about being free from [her] abuser,"</a>&nbsp;as she was under contract to produce more albums with him.&nbsp;While the legal proceedings have yet to be entirely resolved, Dr. Luke has since exited the record label and Kesha has released two albums with the label.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How The Lawsuit Against Dr. Luke Left Kesha With A $5 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=leah-remini><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Leah Remini</span></h2><p><a href=#>Leah Remini</a> is known for her role on hit sitcom The King of Queens, but is equally known for her time as a member of the Church of Scientology.
