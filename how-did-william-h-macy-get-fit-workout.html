Macy’s career, he has been best known for playing characters who are known for their brains. More recently, Macy has spent years starring in the show Shameless. While Macy’s character <a href=#>Frank Gallagher is known for being willing to do outrageous things</a> and being extremely resourceful, he often looked sickly in the role. As a result of the roles that Macy has embodied over the years, it makes sense that most people perceive the actor as being physically weak.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Did William H Macy Make As Frank Gallagher On 'Shameless'?</a></span></p><p>As anyone who pays attention to major red carpet events should already know, there are a lot of <a href=#>celebrities that never skip the gym</a>. For that reason, the fact that Macy has always seemed like more of an average Joe has allowed him to stand out among his Hollywood peers. As it turns out, however, it has become clear that Macy is in amazing shape in recent years. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, what is the real way that Macy has become so fit?</p><h2 id=how-it-became-clear-that-william-h-macy-is-in-amazing-shape>How It Became Clear That William H. Macy Is In Amazing Shape</h2><p>When looking at William H. Macy’s career, it is pretty amazing that anyone knows him by name other than major movie buffs. After all, based on the way that Macy has always looked and the roles he has taken on throughout his career, it seems very clear that he should be a character actor. Fortunately, however, Macy is such a talented actor that he has managed to make the most of pretty much every role he has taken on. As a result, <a href=#>Macy has managed to become rich</a> since he has landed more and more prominent roles throughout his career and become a legitimate film and television star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Was William H. Macy's Most Profitable Role</a></span></p><p>Even though William H. Macy deserves to take a lot of pride in beating the odds in Hollywood, that doesn’t mean he will ever become an action star. After all, if anyone tried to cast Macy in the kind of roles that made Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone famous, that would be laughable. For that reason, Macy’s fans will almost certainly never see the talented actor on the big screen flexing his muscles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Has A Higher Net Worth: Arnold Schwarzenegger Or Sylvester Stallone?</a></span></p><p>On top of never playing huge action stars on the big or little screen, William H. Macy isn’t the kind of star who is overly boastful during interviews. With that in mind, it makes sense that a lot of people have no idea that Macy is in amazing shape. Furthermore, it begs an obvious question, how does anyone know that Macy is a really fit guy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, William H. Macy isn’t the one who revealed that he is extremely fit for his age. Instead, the person who is responsible for that is whoever runs the Instagram account @vitality_athletics. After all, in 2018 a video of Macy at a CrossFit gym climbing a rope was uploaded to that account. While most people these days can’t climb a rope at all, the way that Macy pulled off that feat was all the more impressive. After all, while Macy was climbing the rope, he never engaged his legs in any way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-real-way-william-h-macy-got-in-amazing-shape>The Real Way William H. Macy Got In Amazing Shape</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, William H. Macy is 72 years old according to Wikipedia. Sadly, a lot of people who reach that age find it difficult to move around freely, let alone climb a rope with their arm strength alone. For that reason, when the video of Macy rope climbing was released on Instagram, the popular actor was asked about his accomplishment during an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden. Unsurprisingly, Macy initially reacted by downplaying how fit he is before explaining part of his health regimen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to what William H. Macy said in the aforementioned interview, he “work[s] out” and he has a “brilliant trainer” that his wife Felicity Huffman uses as well. On top of that, Macy explained that he is a practitioner of yoga thanks to Huffman convincing him to give it a try. “I do all the stuff, I do yoga” “I started many years ago, you know, it's either take yoga or look like a question mark when you get older. I started, Felicity kept wanting me to go and I finally went this yoga class in Hawaii.”</p><p>Even though there are a lot of people in the world who stay fit solely through practicing yoga, it is clear that William H. Macy does more than that thanks to the paparazzi. After all, the paparazzi have snapped photos of Macy and his longtime wife Felicity Huffman exercising in public over the years. For example, in 2014 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple was photographed swimming, biking, and hiking</a> while on vacation in Hawaii. Five years after that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple was photographed out for a hike</a> together. Clearly, Macy leads an all-around healthy lifestyle which has allowed him to get in amazing shape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Gerard Butler's Insane Training Nearly Ruined His Body</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledaio6WhkaJ6qXnMmpqyZZeawW6yyK1ksKeioLy2wI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./britney-spears-relationship-with-kevin-federlines-wife-victoria-prince-after-bitter-divorce.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Britney Spears Have A Relationship With Kevin Federline's Wife Victoria Prince After Their Bitte</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christopher-alesund-get-right-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-55461-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christopher Alesund GeT RiGhT Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagr</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
