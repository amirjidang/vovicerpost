Despite having starred in films prior to her risqué role, Dakota Johnson instantly became a household name after the commercial success of the film. While playing Anastasia Steele has opened up countless doors for Dakota, she isn't a stranger to the limelight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star is daughter to celeb parents Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Dakota has been familiar with Hollywood since childhood, so it was only fitting that she follow in her parents' footsteps. With&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a career as expansive and successful as hers</a>, it's no surprise that she's living it up in her $3.55 million Sunset Strip home!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Dakota Johnson: What She's Been Up To Since The Fifty Shades Trilogy</a></span></p><h2 id=a-subtle-hollywood-home>A Subtle Hollywood Home</h2><p>Dakota Johnson made her film debut way back in 1999 when she was only 10 years old! The star appeared alongside her mother, Melanie Griffith in "Crazy In Alabama". While her next acting job only came about 11 years later in "The Social Network", she has certainly found her niche in Hollywood and doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. Although Dakota comes from an affluent background and wealthy parents, the actress herself has managed to amass a rather impressive net worth from her work and her work alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a net worth of $14 million,</a>&nbsp;according to Celebrity Net Worth, Dakota Johnson has done quite well for herself, so much so that she bought a $3.55 million home on Sunset Strip. The purchase was completely off-market, making it incredibly difficult to figure out who purchased the stunning 1947 home. It was only a year later that the public discovered Dakota Johnson was the secret buyer all along. The star recently appeared on a quarantined episode of "Jimmy Kimmel Live" in her backyard, which makes sense considering she is neighbors with Jimmy Kimmel!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Surprising Facts About Dakota Johnson's Love Life</a></span></p><p>The home is incredibly in tune with Dakota's style, which is why she refers to it as her "anchor". The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-century home was designed by Carl Maston</a> and was previously owned by "Glee" and "American Horror Story" creator, Ryan Murphy. Fans were able to get a sneak peek into her stunning 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms that all span across 3,210 square-feet on Architectural Digest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dakota invited cameras into her home, which is not something she has ever done before, to reveal her warm yet modern take on Los Angeles living. The&nbsp;home is by no means as big as countless other Hollywood celebs, but it is in one of the most sought out after locations, making it well worth the price tag.</p><p>Although Dakota didn't let cameras into her bedroom, she showcased her lovely kitchen, formal dining room, living quarters, and of course, her quaint and super private backyard. If there is one thing that's certain, it's that Dakota is very much an old soul. Her antique pieces and fascinating design throughout her home are very telling in regard to her overall personal style. The home is practically enveloped in wood, making it quite the warm and intimate space.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, Dakota has an array of artwork that she so proudly put on display throughout her home, proving yet again, that she is far from&nbsp;your average celebrity. Her backyard is surrounded by nature, providing the star with a plethora of privacy. While the house is stunning, there is only one problem, Dakota does not get along with her other neighbors, a tale she told during her Architectural Digest interview, proving that even $3.55 million won't guarantee you friendly neighbors!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Photos Of Dakota Johnson That Would Drive Christian Grey Wild</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZJ2Zm6TBonnJqJ%2Bnq5%2BjwG5%2FjG5sZqWZobmqu81mp6unoJq%2FtcWMpaaoo6Niuaq3xGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-did-gotye-somebody-that-i-used-to-know-make-one-hit-wonder.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Did Gotye Really Make From 'Somebody That I Used To Know'?
