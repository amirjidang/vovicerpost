It's so specific, but I love <strong>Ginny and Georgia</strong> and all those stories. I just think they're so good!"</p><p>Alyssa chuckles that even at 23, those are the stories she relates to most, so being cast in one, <strong>"Would be the ultimate dream."</strong></p><p>Given all she's accomplished thus far, something tells us this is a dream well within reach for Alyssa McKay!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Royals of Malibu</strong></a> is the newest podcast from Diversion Audio.
