They started dating in 2011, but eventually married from 2015 to 2017, though their divorce was relatively undramatic by Hollywood standards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The infamously private pair has declined to discuss their break-up in great lengths over the years, but Jennifer was uncharacteristically open about her dating history in a new interview, where she shed light on their failed marriage.</p><p>"It was always a little bit difficult for me in relationships, I think, because I really was kind of alone. I don't know,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jen recently admitted to the Wall Street Journal</a>. "My parents, watching my family's relationship, didn't make me kind of go, 'Oh, I can't wait to do that.'"</p><p>Jennifer's parents were none other than the late John Aniston, known for his role in Days of Our Lives, and her mother, Nancy Dow. Unfortunately, the actress has admitted to having a challenging relationship with her mother. Her parents’ marriage came to an end in 1980 when Jennifer was just 11 years old, which she admits has impacted her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-revealed-why-she-believes-her-relationships-never-work>Jennifer Revealed Why She Believes Her Relationships Never Work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jennifer-aniston-still-cant-watch-the-movie-1b.jpg><p>"I didn't like the idea of sacrificing who you were or what you needed, so I didn't really know how to do that,” the Friends alum continued, reflecting on why her past romances have been unsuccessful. "It was almost easier to just be kind of solo," Jennifer went on. "So, I didn't have any real training in that give-and-take."</p><p>"It's just about not being afraid to say what you need and what you want. And it's still a challenge for me in a relationship," the actress added. "I'm really good at every other job I have, and that's sort of the one area that's a little.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This 'Friends' Actor Was Almost Recast For Not Being As Funny As Jennifer Aniston</a></span></p><p>Interestingly, Jennifer credits her manager Aleen Keshishian for helping her prioritize her career when her romances when sideways. Specifically reflecting on her 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, the actress said, "I'd gone through my divorce, and there was a real shift in my life in terms of coming out from under the rubble of that. And then I was finding my work to be a real place of solace."</p><p>"[Aleen] came in and kind of witnessed how I behaved in the business then, and she would give me these great bits of advice, almost like a pep talk: 'You're going to get on the phone, you're going to address it like this,’” Jen continued.</p><p>Despite their split, Jennifer and Justin reportedly remain on friendly terms. However, the actor hasn’t directly commented on his ex’s recent insight into why her past relationships never stood the test of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrquknrtuwMeeqaitqGKut7vInapmqJGlrrOt2bOgZpqZoLavs4yjnKemmZuys3nAp6CsrJ%2BjerOx1Z6jmqyZpLturcGorK1lpJ2yqr6MppirqpmWtKZ5w6KtqKqTmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kane-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-639358-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kane Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./juan-soto-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-271072-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Juan Soto Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
