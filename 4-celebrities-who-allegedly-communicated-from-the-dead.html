Psychic mediums, whether you believe in them or not, have had some huge breaks on television lately. Self-proclaimed clairvoyants like John Edward and Tyler Henry have been featured on a number of T.V. shows connecting people with their passed on loved ones. If that concept isn’t captivating enough, they’ve even upped the ante by claiming to communicate with some of Hollywood’s finest deceased celebs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hollywood deaths are always a media frenzy, especially when those deaths are controversial and/or mysterious. It’s times like these when high-profile mediums like Edward and Henry can step in and answer questions from beyond the grave. This creepy “gift” of theirs has attracted the attention of stars like Jamie Pressly, the Kardashian family, Nicole Polizzi and Oprah. With clients like that, I suppose they’ve been bound to come across a late celeb or two and with cameras rolling of course.</p><p>Celebrities can’t just go six feet under until the end of time, that would be too average, right? Whether it’s coming through with life-changing advice, insight into their death or a just quick “hello,” these four celebrities didn’t even let death keep them out of the lime light.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-robert-kardashian><strong>4. Robert Kardashian</strong></h2><p>Back in 2011 when <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> was experiencing troubles in her marriage to Kris Humphries, she naturally wanted support and advice from her family, her father included. The only problem? He had died eight years prior of cancer. Kim reached out to John Edward for help in communicating with her father.</p><p>The clip of Edward channeling Robert Kardashian aired on Kourtney and Kim Take New York. During the conversation, a divorce Kim went through when she was 20 is brought up. Edward asks if Kim learned from her first divorce — a question her late father was apparently wondering. She claims she did, and this brief interaction is all it takes for Kim to make up her mind about her current marriage. After the session she reveals to sister Kourtney, “I honestly feel like I can’t do this anymore with Kris.” This would later become the beginning of the end for Kim, Kris and their 72 day marriage. Quite the life-altering words from a ghost.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-brittany-murphy><strong>3. Brittany Murphy</strong></h2><p>The death of <a href=#>Brittany Murphy</a> in 2009 shocked everyone. The actress best known for her roles in films like Clueless and 8 Mile seemed like a healthy and successful 32-year-old. Her death was initially very mysterious and before a coroner’s report had been released rumours swirled as to what could have killed her. The media reported causes like an addiction to prescription drugs, a severe eating disorder and even the possibility of murder. The official report stated that pneumonia and anaemia were to blame for her death. Although this seemed to be a legitimate cause, the events leading up to and following her death kept her family, friends and fans with unanswered questions. For instance, if she was so ill why didn’t she seek any medical attention? And why is it that five months later, her husband ended up dying of the exact same causes?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyler Henry, a psychic to the celebrities met with actress and model Jaime Pressly on his E! series Hollywood Medium. Without exactly knowing who he’s channeling, Henry states he’s communicating with a younger woman who feels she died too soon. He says to Pressly, “She's blaming an outside influence and saying she was in a very manipulative situation.” Henry connects a few dots and determines it’s a Brittany who he’s communicating with. This is the moment Pressly jumps in, “Brittany Murphy…Oh my God.”</p><p>This cryptic information from the late Brittany Murphy may have revealed more about her death than anyone could have known. Brittany’s mother spoke to the media following her daughter’s death claiming Brittany and her husband were overwhelmingly paranoid about paparazzi and lived in isolation. When Brittany was faced with the health issues that killed, her fears of the media prevented her from seeking medical attention. Perhaps this post-mortem message reveals that her husband’s manipulation caused her to develop these anxieties and ultimately die because of them. Henry did use the word “blame” when channeling Brittany, and she was referring to a someone, not a something…eerie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-marilyn-monroe><strong>2. Marilyn Monroe</strong></h2><p>Gloria Vanderbilt is an actress, artist and socialite who became iconic in pop culture during the 1930s. She also happens to be the mother of journalist <a href=#>Anderson Cooper</a>. As a prominent public figure in the 20th century, one would expect she may have rubbed elbows with a few legendary celebrities of that time. However, no one expected what psychic John Edward revealed after sitting down with her for a reading.</p><p>On her son’s talk show Anderson, Gloria spoke to Edward hoping to hear from some loved ones. During the reading, Edward almost hesitates to bring up Marilyn Monroe in disbelief that he is actually connecting to the late star or that there is any connection to be made. Gloria confirms that there is a connection and in fact the two were good friends. Still skeptical, Edward asks the spirit to confirm what is being said and then begins describing a private photo of Marilyn and Gloria. Gloria acknowledges this sentimental photo as something she has. “It’s her way of letting you know it’s me, and I’m okay,” Edward says.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anderson Cooper claims he had no idea his mother and Marilyn Monroe even knew each other up until this reading. John Edward himself called the contact “freaky” as he never expected to ever encounter the Marilyn Monroe. Although she didn’t reveal any information related to her death or say anything sassy you might expect from her, a simple “I’m okay” is still pretty remarkable from someone who died over 50 years ago.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-robin-williams><strong>1. Robin Williams</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Robin Williams</a> committed suicide back in 2014 no one could help but wonder what the hell went wrong. How could the guy who’d been making everyone laugh for decades have been in such a deep depression? His death lead people to campaign all over social media for awareness of mental illness. While the suicide of Robin may ultimately have lead to the conclusion of mental illness, who’s to say that’s all&nbsp;there is&nbsp;to the story?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Comedienne Margaret Cho saw Robin as one of her greatest mentors and knew him personally. In a reading with Tyler Henry on Hollywood Medium she was surprised to know Henry had been channeling Robin for weeks leading up to their meeting. After giving Cho some encouraging words from Robin, Henry touches on the actor’s death. “He doesn’t so much reference to a big, chemical imbalance, as much as, ‘I feel like I have another health issue that I just don’t want to have to suffer through.’”</p><p>Coordinating with Robin’s message is his wife’s revelation to the media. According to Robin’s autopsy he was suffering from dementia which is ultimately what triggered his suicide, not depression. "If Robin was lucky, he would’ve had maybe three years left. And they would’ve been hard years,” his wife stated in an interview. Instead of suffering through what life he had left, Robin’s message reveals he chose to die on his own terms. Inspiring? A Tragedy? Who knows, but apparently Robin wanted to set the record straight from the other side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZm1lk5q5pq7RoquinaNixKm7jJqjpZ2XmrGtxYycpqalpaO2pK3TnptmnqKkum7Ax55knZ2RmXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./actingliketommy-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-82520-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Actingliketommy Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./25-characters-who-are-pretty-in-real-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>25 Ugly Show Characters Who Are Hot In Real Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
