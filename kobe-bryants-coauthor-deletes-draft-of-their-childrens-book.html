The basketball legend and wife <strong><a href=#>Vanessa Bryant</a> </strong>shared<a href=#> four daughters:</a> Natalia, 17, Gianna, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months.</p><p>Coelho further explained his decision not move forward with the book plans on Monday, January 27.</p><p>“I deleted the draft because it didn’t make any sense to publish without him,” the Brazilian lyricist told the Associated Press. “It wouldn’t add anything relevant to him or his family.”</p><p>Coelho added that he may write about his experiences with Kobe in the future.</p><p>“That doesn’t stop me from writing someday about things I learned from Kobe and how much of a larger-than-life person he was,” he explained. “But the children’s book did not make sense anymore. … I saw him enough times to assure he had much more than sports on his mind, it wasn’t all about competition.”</p><p>The author concluded: “His tragic death has shown already how he was important to the world, not only to the United States. We will discuss his legacy for many years, much beyond sport.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Coelho isn’t the only person who was working with Kobe before his untimely passing. Actress <a href=#><strong>Olivia Munn</strong> revealed she was set to meet with him this week</a> “to brainstorm more parts of the epic world you were creating” at his multi-media original content company, Granity Studios.</p><p>“You were creating a whole big world from scratch- everything from the continents to the oceans and rivers to the trees and even the leaves on the trees,” Munn wrote on Monday via Instagram. “The last time we talked, I told you my idea about what the night sky would be made of. I was inspired by friends of mine who lost their 4-year-old daughter to cancer. … ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣We wanted to help kids be less afraid of death and tell stories of all the little and big stars…. And now you’re one of them. 😞⭐️⁣⁣⁣”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp5KaeqO%2B2JqlratdmLyiwdOhpqtllJq5psDErGSdqpGbwW67xWaroZ2Zp3qktMilm6udnqh6o7vOpGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lily-gladstone-says-leonardo-dicaprio-teases-her-like-a-big-brother.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lily Gladstone Says Leonardo DiCaprio Teases Her Like a Big Brother</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-shows-bare-butt-tiny-black-thong-bikini.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian shows off bare butt in tiny black thong bikini as she hits the beach with longtime pa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
