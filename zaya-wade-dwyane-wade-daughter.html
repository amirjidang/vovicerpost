Since then, she has established a name for herself in the transgender community.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Zaya Wade?</h2><p>The eldest child of former NBA star Dwyane Wade is Zaya Wade. Gabrielle Union, an actress, is her stepmother. Zaya revealed to her parents that she was a transgender girl at the age of 12, something her father thinks she knew since she was three.&nbsp;</p><p>In February 2020, Zaya and her family decided to openly reveal her gender so that she may live as herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dwyane-Wade-Daughter-683x1024.jpg><p>The following month, Union and Dwayne joined Zaya for a red carpet appearance. She has gained notoriety as a notable young member of the LGBTQ+ community since that time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zaya Wade Early Life&nbsp;</h2><p>May 29, 2007 saw the birth of Zaya Wade.

In addition, Zaya’s cousin Dahveon Morris is under the father’s supervision.</p><p>Dwyane and Union were inspired by Zaya to learn more about the transgender community, which including speaking with the Pose actors.</p><p><strong>“We just tried to figure out as much information as we can to make sure we give our child the best opportunity to be her best self.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mental Health & Coming Out Of The Closet&nbsp;</h2><p>Zaya Wade, 14, is very aware of the importance of mental health in her life. She lives in secrecy under the protection of her well-known parents despite being the stepdaughter of actress Gabrielle Union and the daughter of retired NBA player Dwyane Wade and Siohvaughn Funches.</p><p>Celebrity may be agonizing and make being a teenage Black girl more complicated, but Zaya handles it with a warm sense of self and strong limits. Zaya came out as trans in 2020, to the support of her family and the support of young LGBTQ+ people all across the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Her decision to come out as she is has inspired others to follow suit. She is inspiring and motivating younger generations while continuing to be a positive role model for herself.</p><p>In December 2019, Dwyane used her pronouns for the first time when referring to Zaya.</p><p>On February 11, 2020, he said that <strong>“Zaya was a female and used the pronouns she/her when appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.&nbsp;“</strong></p><p>After Dwyane’s appearance on Ellen, Union posted a video to Twitter with the opening, “<strong>Zaya, please. She is empathetic, caring, and incredibly intelligent, and we are so proud of her</strong>.” “<strong>Be true to yourself – what’s the point of being on this Earth if you’re going to try and be someone you’re not?</strong>” Zaya advised in the footage.</p><p><strong>I would say every morning and every night I look in the mirror and I tell myself, ‘I’m beautiful, I’m worth it and this day is going to be great.</strong>’ And at night I say, ‘<strong>I’m still beautiful and still worth it. And tomorrow is going to be great.</strong>’ And I have to tell myself that every day. I think it really helps me get through each day and start off another day on a positive note.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zaya Is An Icon For The LGBTQ+ Community&nbsp;</h2><p>In 2019, Zaya went to Miami Pride with Union. She attended the Truth Awards in Los Angeles in March 2020 to recognise achievements in the Black LGBTQ+ community.&nbsp;</p><p>The 12-year-old wore matching tailored suits as the three men, Dwyane, and Union, walked the red carpet together. Zaya said when asked how it made her feel to serve as an inspiration to others,</p><p><strong>“I really like how it feels. I feel like I’ve always been intended to accomplish something, and I believe I’ve found it.”</strong></p><p>“<strong>Everyone allowed her to re-introduce herself. Her name is Zaya Wade</strong>!,” Her father posted on Instagram “<strong>Last night was Zaya’s first red carpet and we couldn’t have been prouder of how she handled the questions that were asked of her. She has emerged as one of the young faces and voices for the LGBTQ+ community</strong>.”</p><p>Zaya became an icon for the LGBTQ+ community and beyond after coming out. As a Black person who has strived to better the world, she was chosen as one of The Advocate’s Women of the Year and as one of The Root’s Young Futurists in 2020.</p><p>In March 2021, Zaya spoke with the former first lady Michelle Obama in conjunction with the publication of a younger reader’s edition of Obama’s memoir Becoming.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDGwLKYZq%2BRmbJusNaymKedXayupbGMnZiun5ipsrN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kanye-west-kim-kardashian-cheated-chris-paul-twitter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Did Not Cheat on Kanye West with Chris Paul, Sources</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yvonne-adkison-age-wiki-biography-bering-sea-gold-vern-adkison-daughters.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yvonne Adkison Age, Wiki, Biography, Bering Sea Gold Vern Adkison Daughters.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
