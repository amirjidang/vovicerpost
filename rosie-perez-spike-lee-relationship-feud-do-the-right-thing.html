More recently, Perez has had a career resurgence which has reminded many fans of what makes her so awesome.</p><p>Years before any of those accomplishments, Perez made her screen debut in one of <a href=#>the '80s most controversial movies</a>, Do the Right Thing. As it turns out, Perez only landed that role because she made director Spike Lee mad at her.</p><h2 id=why-did-spike-lee-cast-rosie-perez-in-do-the-right-thing>Why Did Spike Lee Cast Rosie Perez In Do The Right Thing?</h2><p>During Rosie Perez's career, she has certainly made her mark on Hollywood history. An extremely memorable actor who has enjoyed a great deal of success, Perez has starred in several films that have gone down in history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rosie-perez-fired-her-agent-after-she-was-told-to-undergo-plastic-surgery-and-change-hair-color.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arguably best remembered for starring in White Men Can't Jump, Perez has also starred in several other movies over the years. Some of Perez's most notable other film roles were in movies like Fearless, It Could Happen to You, The Road to El Dorado, Pineapple Express, and Birds of Prey. Perez also recently starred in The Flight Attendant, a show that was headlined by Kaley Cuoco.</p><p>During Perez's career, she has also earned the respect of her peers. Thanks to her role in the film Fearless, Perez was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. Perez has also been nominated for a slew of other trophies including five Emmy Awards.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Times Arguments That Got So Heated On The View The Hosts Almost Walked Off</a></span></p><p>Before Perez achieved all of that, her Hollywood career really began when she landed her first IMDb-credited film role. In 1989, Perez portrayed Tina, a memorable character from Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many years after Do the Right Thing was released. Spike Lee took part in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session. During that session, a Reddit user asked Lee an extremely open-ended question about his career and life. "Can you tell us a cool anecdote you've wanted to share?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rosie-perez-from-do-the-right-thing.jpg><p>Based on that question, Lee could have brought up any story from his amazing life. For that reason, it is fascinating that Lee opted to tell the story of the first time he met Perez and the moment that led to him casting her in Do the Right Thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lee started his story by revealing he held a birthday party for himself in 1989. At the party, Lee had the then-popular R&B group E.U. perform a song that was a hit for them at the time. As Lee surveyed his party, he observed Perez for the first time and even though they would go on to work together, their introduction was explosive.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rosie Perez Revealed Jennifer Lopez Manipulated The Wardrobe And Makeup To Her Advantage During In Living Color</a></span></p><p>"This lady was dancing crazy on top of a speaker, I told her to get down, because if she fell, her neck would be broken and I would be sued. So finally she jumped off the speaker and started cursing me out in a voice I'd never heard before."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rosie-perez-and-spike-lee-s-turbulent-relationship-launched-her-career-in-do-the-right-thing.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I asked her where she was from, and she said she was from Brooklyn.

Despite that, Perez and Lee haven't collaborated on a movie together in almost 45 years as of this writing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SpikeLee.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout Lee's career, it has often seemed like he has had a lot of freedom in terms of who he casts in his films. With that in mind, it makes observers wonder why Perez and Lee didn't work together for decades.</p><p>As it turns out, Perez and Lee haven't always seen eye to eye. For example, it seems pretty clear that Perez resents the perception that Lee simply cast her in Do the Right Thing after they first met. In 2023, Perez spoke to Variety for a profile of her career and she attempted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clarify that she had to earn her Do the Right Thing role</a>.</p><p>According to Perez's version of events, she met Lee in a club, and he gave her his card. From there, Perez says that Lee made her fight to be cast in Do the Right Thing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The View's Production Team Unexpectedly Played Wrap-Up Music And Cut To A Commercial While Joy Behar Tried Promoting A Book</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I didn’t understand who he was. And I didn’t care. I threw the card away. My girlfriend Marian went back and got it. She always joked, ‘You owe your entire career to me.’ You know, I did audition for ‘Do the Right Thing.’ People think that Spike just discovered me and gave me the role. No, he made me work for it.”</p><p>During a separate interview with The New York Times from the year 2000, Perez spoke about a more important issue in her relationship with Lee. According to what Perez said in that interview, she filmed a revealing scene for Do the Right Thing and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had a really bad experience</a>.</p><p>"I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think -- that's what was really bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't correct." "The reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I don't want to do this."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/spike-lee-and-rosie-perez-from-variety-s-2023-power-of-women-event-at-the-grill.jpg><p>While speaking to Variety for their aforementioned 2023 profile, Perez didn't take back her comments to The New York Times. However, Perez expressed her opinion that people overreacted to her comments and revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Lee made peace</a>.</p><p>“In our cancel culture, some people need to be canceled. And when I was telling the story, people were ready to cancel Spike Lee and cancel me for saying something. And I was like, ‘You know what? This is getting out of hand.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Here’s the thing. It happened. We discussed it, we made up, we hugged it out, and we’re still friends to this day." Perez continued, "And sometimes people need a chance to say, ‘I’m sorry.’ For a man of his stature to say ‘I’m sorry’ is huge. But that’s why I don’t like to talk about it — because people get too crazy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipqKuZmnqxsdGesWaroJ64pnnLnpxmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYrOmwcNmm6hlpJ2ybr7IoJ%2BtZaSdtq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rusty-cage-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-639078-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rusty Cage Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-did-robert-downey-jr-s-dad-say-about-iron-man-superhero-movies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Downey Jr.'s Dad Had Some Pretty Strong Opinions About Iron Man, Here's What He Really Said A</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
