She's fortunate to have rich and famous parents. Blue is the daughter of Jay-Z and Beyonce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Together, Jay and Bey are worth about $1.4 billion. They've made a name for themselves in the music industry.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z and Beyonce</a> have also launched several extremely&nbsp;profitable businesses. In addition, they are part-owners is several businesses that have made millions of dollars. Blue Ivy has stated that she plans to become a pop star one day.</p><p>There's no doubt that having parents who rule the world of entertainment is going to help Blue Ivy access opportunities. Whether or not she becomes a big singing sensation, Blue Ivy always has her inheritance to look forward to. Here's how that $1 billion was generated.</p><h2 id=80-000-doll><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>$80,000 Doll</span></h2><p>What's so special about this doll, and why is it worth so much money? Well, it's diamond-encrusted. It's nice to have rich parents because your birthday gift is likely to be something extravagant. In Blue Ivy's case, her birthday gift made her $80,000 dollars richer.&nbsp;That's definitely one of the most expensive dolls in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clothing-label-rocawear><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Clothing Label Rocawear</span></h2><p>First, it was Roc-A-Fella records, which became one of hip hop's biggest labels. Then, Jay saw that there was a big demand for merchandise, so he started Rocawear. In 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Enterprise</a>, Jay-Z bought intellectual property for Rocawear back for $15 million.</p><h2 id=singing-career><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Singing Career</span></h2><p>It's not only Jay-Z and Beyonce who have found joy and success behind microphones. It seems that singing talent runs in the family, and Blue Ivy has launched her own singing career. Not only did she drop a single, but she also won a Soul Train Award for a song that she co-wrote with her mom.</p><h2 id=fragrance-brand><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Fragrance Brand</span></h2><p>One of the ventures that most celebrities explore, besides fashion, is fragrances. That's exactly what Beyonce did by launching her collection of perfumes. Some of the fragrances in the collection are Heat, Pulse, and Rise. It was back in 2010 that Beyonce launched Heat, which is her most prominent scent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=art-collection><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Art Collection</span></h2><p>When Blue Ivy isn't singing, she's bidding at art auctions. When you've got parents with cash, you can make a $25,000 bid on an art piece. Jay-Z wasn't impressed with his daughter's bidding, so he stopped it, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>. Then, she bid on a piece by Samuel Levi Jones for $13,000. Hers was the winning bid.</p><h2 id=signing-big-artists-through-roc-a-fella-record-company><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Signing Big Artists Through Roc-A-Fella Record Company</span></h2><p>It was back in 1995 that Jay-Z started Roc-A-Fella Records with Damon Dash and Biggs. The company operated as a division of Def Jam Records and signed popular artists, such as Kanye West, Memphis Bleek, and Jadakiss. Blue Ivy will profit from the 50% ownership that Jay-Z, Dash, and Biggs had, before selling their half share in the label to The Island Def Jam Music Group.</p><h2 id=ownership-in-nba-team-new-jersey-nets><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ownership In NBA Team New Jersey Nets</span></h2><p>The 'in thing' these days is to own a sports team. Just ask billionaires, such as Mark Cuban, Tilman Fertitta, and Charles Dolan. Since Jay-Z is a billionaire, it makes sense that he owned a share of the New Jersey Nets. He held only one-fifth of a percent before deciding to sell it. Jay-Z bought that ownership for $ 1 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ownership-in-tidal><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ownership In Tidal</span></h2><p>There's no doubt that the music industry can be profitable...if you're able to appeal to the masses. Since technology has taken the music industry to the next level, it makes sense that Jay-Z would get involved in Tidal, which is an artist-owned streaming service that is available in over 50 countries.</p><h2 id=investor-in-jetsmarter><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Investor In JetSmarter</span></h2><p>If you're going to travel private, then you might as well have shares in the business. Jay-Z received a private jet as a birthday gift from Beyonce, and he realized that there was an increase in demand for private and shared flights. Jay-Z was one of the early investors in the company.</p><h2 id=armand-de-brignac-owner><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Armand de Brignac Owner</span></h2><p>Alcohol will never go out of fashion. One of the alcohol brands that Jay-Z got involved with was Ace of Spades premium champagne, which is otherwise known as Armand de Brignac. Having Jay-Z promote it in the clubs definitely helped the brand. Don't be surprised if you pay $850 for one bottle of the limited-edition bubbly. It's even more than that at the most exclusive nightclubs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z To Tyler, The Creator: Your Favorite Rappers And Their Careers' Best Year</a></span></p><h2 id=ivy-park-clothing-line><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ivy Park Clothing Line</span></h2><p>Back in 2016, Beyonce collaborated with Sir Phillip Green to introduce the Ivy Park clothing line. The company marketed the line as activewear for women who want to look and feel like they're at the top of their games. To grow the brand, Beyonce teamed up with Adidas and called it Ivy Park x Adidas.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Other Stars Have Said About Beyonce (Good And Bad)</a></span></p><h2 id=part-ownership-in-dusse><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Part Ownership In Dusse</span></h2><p>It's not just Ace of Spades champagne that Jay-Z got involved with while dabbling in the liquor industry; he also got a share in D'Usse, which is a premium cognac brand. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a> reported that D'Usse released a limited-edition barrel in honor of Jay-Z's 50th birthday. If you wanted one, you would have had to pay $5,000.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z's Rider Proves He's A Modest Billionaire</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=owner-of-40-40-club-in-new-york><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Owner Of 40/40 Club In New York</span></h2><p>When Jay-Z opens a club, you know that it's going to be special. The 40/40 club is regarded as a sports bar and lounge, and it's owned by Jay-Z and Juan Perez. They borrowed the name from a baseball term given to players who achieve 40 home runs and 40 stolen bases in a season.</p><h2 id=11-000-dress><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>$11,000 Dress</span></h2><p>When stars attend special events, they do it in style. Not only do they show up in some of the best cars, but they also wear extravagant clothing. When Blue Ivy was four years old, she accompanied her mother to the 2016 VMAs. To arrive in style, she wore a dress valued at $11,000.</p><h2 id=200-million-contract-with-live-nation-entertainment><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>$200 Million Contract With Live Nation Entertainment</span></h2><p>One of the ventures that catapulted Jay-Z closer to billionaire status was signing a 10-year deal with Live Nation. It was back in 2017 that Jay-Z did a deal for $200 million with Live Nation, to do tours over a period of 10 years. Jay-Z previously signed a deal with Live Nation (in 2008), which was successful.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Things Beyonce And Jay-Z's Employees Have Said About Working For Them</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpa2VYra3xYycmKuslad6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-cremate-someone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Does It Cost to Cremate Someone?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fergie-addiction-overdose-drug-use-black-eyed-peas-career-what-happened.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Fergie Almost Never Had A Music Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
