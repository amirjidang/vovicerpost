His cutting-edge humor was the birth of the modern-day “hot take” and his observational humor, some of it lighthearted and some of it hardcore, endeared him to his followers all the same. The use of the word “follower” there is quite intentional because Carlin’s fans at the end of his life didn’t just laugh at the comic's jokes, they hung on his every word because he brought visibility to some of the most disillusioned people in the world. To Carlin’s followers, he was the prophet of rejecting self-proclaimed prophets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Howard Stern Avoided Stand-Up Comedy</a></span></p><p>Carlin’s comedy career was one that stretched at least four decades. He started as a run-of-the-mill nightclub comic in the 1960s and by the end of that decade was making a healthy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$250,000 a year.</a> But later Carlin evolved into a playful stoner comic, especially as he grew in popularity in the 1970s, especially when his bit Seven Dirty Words You Can’t Say On Television, caused a <a href=#>Supreme Court</a> case, the effects of which are the subject of censorship debates to this day. From the 1980s to the end of his life in 2008 he became the man who wasn’t afraid to “tell it like it is” as the old turn of phrase goes.</p><p>Carlin, though outward and vicarious on stage, led a relatively private personal life. Little is known about the comic legend other than his few stints in rehab and that he has a daughter named Kelly Carlin, who now works as a writer and actor in Hollywood. What was the story of Carlin’s career? And how much was the icon worth when he died?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-in-debt-for-almost-20-years><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Was In Debt For Almost 20 Years</span></h2><p>Not many people know that because of George Carlin’s struggles with drugs and alcohol he ended up with some unpaid tax bills that would land him in pretty serious debt for at least two decades of his career. While the total is difficult to calculate, Carlin believed that the total ended up being around an approximate <a href=#>$3 million.</a></p><h2 id=he-was-the-host-of-the-first-episode-of-39-snl-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Was The Host Of The First Episode of 'SNL'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carlin had a long resume outside of stand-up comedy. Several television and film appearances and by the end of his life he had 14 HBO comedy specials to his name. But one of his most notable performances was when he hosted the inaugural first episode of <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>, which is now in its 45th season. How much Carlin was paid for the episode is undisclosed, but considering the fact that the original cast was only paid $750 an episode, we can ballpark that it wasn’t substantial.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To These SNL Castmembers After They Were Fired</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-in-an-iconic-80s-movie><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Was In An Iconic 80s Movie</span></h2><p>Among George Carlin’s film resume, one of his most beloved roles was as Rufus, Bill and Ted’s time-traveling savior in <a href=#>Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure</a>. His paycheck for the movie is undisclosed, but the film grossed over $40 million internationally against its meager $6 million budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-tenure-on-children-rsquo-s-television><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>His Tenure On Children’s Television</span></h2><p>Many often forget that the man who authored The Seven Dirty Words You Can’t Say On Television or Radio, also had a role in the popular children's program Thomas The Tank Engine, narrating its fourth season. He also played Mr. Conductor for two seasons on the show Shining Time Station. Carlin would leave the series to focus on his stand-up, where could be a little more crude than he could be on the PBS programs.</p><h2 id=he-wrote-several-best-selling-books><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Wrote Several Best Selling Books</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carlin brought his humor to the pen when he turned several of his routines into comedy books filled with his observations and hot takes. Titles under his belt included Brain Droppings,Napalm and Silly Putty, its sequel More Napalm and Silly Putty, and When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops. Carlin wrote at least half a dozen books in his lifetime, and the three books mentioned above were all on the New York Times bestseller list for months after their release.</p><h2 id=his-shows-sold-out-until-the-day-he-died><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>His Shows Sold Out Until The Day He Died</span></h2><p>Carlin kept performing well into the last years of his life, and he died just months after his latest <a href=#>HBO</a> special Its Bad for Ya, was released. Although in his 70s when he died, Carlin was showing no signs that he intended to slow down touring or stop performing stand-up, especially because his tours were still selling out tickets at record rates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> How Stand-up Comic Amy Schumer Trolled Donald Trump</a></span></p><h2 id=his-final-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Final Net Worth</span></h2><p>Celebrity net worth websites estimate that, despite his tax issues and the financial drawbacks of his addictions, George Carlin could claim a net worth of $10 million when he died. Even though Carlin left us over 10 years ago, his albums and books continue to sell and clips of his stand-up specials continue to circulate. You also can’t open up Instagram or Facebook without seeing at least one mutual friend share a meme with a Carlin quote. Arguably, the man is still as popular today as he was the day he died. Along with his $10 million, Carlin left behind a legacy that any comedian would be jealous to have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Judd Apatow Is Making A George Carlin Documentary</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIywmKxll5q8s7PEZpqaqpyeu27DzquroWWnnbKveceeZJ2hlZl6pLvMnpuimZ5ifnF5zKKjpaGfo3qvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-david-laid-of-russian-origin-his-nationality-and-ethnicity-details-explored-326074-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is David Laid Of Russian Origin?
