He rose quickly through the ranks with songs like Look at Me, which peaked at number 34 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The rapper seemed destined for a long and successful career until he was shot dead in 2018. However, in his short career, XXXtentacion was able to amass up to $5 million in net worth.</p><p>We take a look at how he achieved his enviable fortune in a short time, as well as who inherited his wealth after he passed. Check it out below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-xxxtentacion-achieved-his-net-worth></span><strong>How XXXTentacion Achieved His Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite having a difficult childhood, which was laced with poverty and child abuse, XXXTentacion harbored hopes of making it out of his family’s limitations and becoming someone of importance. He was convinced he would make it through music and thus, he began his career at the age of 15.</p><p>Just as he dreamed it, the bulk of XXXTentacion’s net worth came via music, with the rest coming from social media and business dealings.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-sold-a-significant-amount-of-records></span><strong>He Sold a Significant Amount of Records</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Like most modern artists, XXXTentacion began his career on the music platform, SoundCloud, in 2013. His first song was News/Flock. He followed it up with Vice City before releasing his first EP, The Fall, about a year after in November 2014.</p><p>His developmental phase as a musician saw him work with several aspiring musicians like Ski Mas the Slump God, with whom he released the mixtape, Members Only Vol. 1.</p><p>He released his second EP; Willy Wonka Was a Child Murderer in April 2016. While his music projects at the time did not particularly make a significant dent on his net worth, XXXTentacion’s profile as a rapper increased with each release.</p><p>In 2017, XXXTentacion finally achieved a mainstream breakthrough with the track, Look at Me. The song, which was first released on SoundCloud, reached number two on the platform and peaked at number 34 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single went platinum after selling more than one million copies. It also recorded more than 161 plays on SoundCloud.</p><p>The single became the calling card for which XXXTentacion’s career exploded and he became the toast of several major music labels. He eventually committed to Empire Distribution in a six-figure deal that ensured full creative control and low royalty rate for the Florida-born rapper.</p><p>He followed up his Look at Me success with the mixtape, Revenge. Although it did not match the commercial success of Look at Me, it performed well for a mixtape. It sold more than 500,000 copies in the US alone, with additional success in major music markets like Norway, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, and New Zealand.</p><p>After a long wait, XXXTentacion released his first album, 17, in August 2017. The album performed reasonably well commercially, even though it received a mixed response from critics. It debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200, selling 86,000 copies in its first week alone. The piece also gave XXXTentacion the second major boost to his net worth. Seven songs on the album, including Fuck Love and Revenge, debuted on Billboard Hot 100, and the album sold more than one million copies.</p><p>Before he died in 2018, XXXTentacion released another album. His second album, ?, went platinum, with more than one million copies sold.</p><p>XXXTentacion was able to accrue his $5 million net worth with more than 2.5 million sold records, as well as earnings from EPs and mixtapes. Aside from album sales, XXXTentacion also earned from The Revenge Tour, which consisted of 26 venues across the US, which were sold out.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=social-media></span><strong>Social Media</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Another contributor to XXXTentacion’s $5 million net worth was social media, particularly YouTube. He created his YouTube channel, xxxtentacion, in June 2015.</p><p>Before his death, the channel had more than ten million subscribers and many views, earning a substantial sum via ad revenue. Even after his death, the rapper continued to earn via the channel which now has more than 22 million subscribers and more than 5.2 billion views. According to SocialBlade, the channel earns him $284,100 to $4.5 million annually.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-controls-xxxtentacions-estate></span><strong>Who Controls XXXTentacion’s Estate?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following the passing of XXXTentacion, his mother, Cleopatra Bernard, assumed control of his financial and intellectual estate. His mother now owns and controls earnings from his past works, as well as his assets, which include a mansion in Parkland, Florida, bought for $1.5 million in November 2017.</p><p>Since he passed, his mother has sanctioned the release of two albums, Skins and Bad Vibes Forever, both of which had impressive commercial performances.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35utM6wZLGwqKmyr8DAnKCopl2WsKm1xK%2BcnWWRYrumwIywpqusmGK8p3mUZqSipJyevK95wZ6dqKqVYrWqv4yupa2hnZq5unnDnpitoF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-gandolfini-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Gandolfini Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-why-jamie-foxx-didnt-like-kissing-beyonce-in-dreamgirls.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heres Why Jamie Foxx Didnt Like Kissing Beyonce In Dreamgirls</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
