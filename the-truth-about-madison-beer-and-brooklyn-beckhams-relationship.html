But there's nothing out there to suggest that something actually went on between them. This is not the case, however, when it comes to a potential relationship between Madison and Victoria and David Beckham's son, Brooklyn. Back in 2017, when Brooklyn weirdly looked almost identical to Justin Bieber, Madison was spotted with him at several events. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to HollyScoop</a>, the pair first became close at Coachella. While there have been countless rumors about celebrity couples, Brooklyn has notoriously made his romances public knowledge. This is because the young man is big on the PDA. Even his current fiance, <a href=#>the exceedingly wealthy Nicola Peltz</a>, can't stop being the focus of what some call <a href=#>over-the-top displays of affection</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Brooklyn and Madison have been extremely coy about what did or didn't go on between them in 2017. While some <a href=#>fans were surprised by Madison's rise into stardom</a>, they weren't exactly surprised that something might have gone down between her and Beckham. Both were hot, young, ran in the same social group, and had pockets full of cash... and then there's the fact that Brooklyn is notoriously... well.. a ladies man (to put it politely). Still, there's tons of conflicting information about what actually went down between them. Here's what we know...</p><h2 id=madison-denied-the-rumors>Madison Denied The Rumors</h2><p>After flirting at Coachella, multiple news outlets jumped on the chance to claim that Madison and Brooklyn were dating. However, Madison was actually there with her now ex-boyfriend, Jack Gilinsky. The two were on each other's arms for most of the event and it didn't appear as though she was running away to hang out with Brooklyn. While the Coachella rumors may have been false, things took a turn a couple of months later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did Madison break up with Jack shortly after Coachella but sources told Page Six that she and Brooklyn had been dating for months. Of course, the two stars themselves didn't confirm this so it became a topic of discussion when Madison was doing press for her music. During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2017 interview with BUILD</a>, when both Madison and Brooklyn were 18-years-old, the Justin Beiber protege claimed that nothing was going on between her and Victoria and David's son. Although, she did appear to have a bit of a crush on him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What It's Like To Date Brooklyn Beckham, According To His Ex-Girlfriends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've known Brooklyn for years, we've been really close and as we've gotten older â€” and I'm newly out of a relationship, we're definitely like crushing on each other. But we're both very busy. I just think it's like... I dunno... I dunno... He's great, though. He's a cutie, literally one of my best friends which is hard because every time I'm seen with him everyone's like, 'Oh my god, they're boyfriend and girlfriend'. But like, we're seriously just best friends. We hang out almost every day with our whole group of friends in L.A. together. And he's moving to New York soon. So, it's just kind of like we're just having fun right now and rumors are gonna get started. I also have a big double standard issue. I am always very vocal about my issue with double standards and how a guy can be seen with like 50 girls and not be said a word about and a girl is seen with one and it's like, 'Oh my god, she's this, she's that.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then, she's said that she is very open with her fanbase about her personal life. Although she could be very secretive and sneaky about her personal life, Madison claimed that she hasn't been.</p><p>"Me and Brooklyn could very easily go through the back of places and we can do whatever. But I'm not sneaky and I don't lie. I think I'm allowed to live my life and have fun and do as I please."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Are Obsessed With Madison Beer Without Makeup</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-madison-not-actually-being-authentic-about-her-relationship-with-brooklyn>Was Madison Not Actually Being Authentic About Her Relationship With Brooklyn?</h2><p>Even though Madison stated that nothing went on between her and Brooklyn, a couple of weeks prior to the 2017 BUILD interview, she was spotted kissing Brooklyn during a shopping trip, according to Celeb Scoop. So, it really did appear as though something was going on between them. Additionally, The Star reported that the two were, in fact, together, and that a source close to the Beckham family said that Victoria was furious about her son's involvement with Madison.</p><p>According to The Star's source, Victoria believed that Madison was using Brooklyn to up her star profile. On top of this, Victoria apparently judged her for looking too much like a Kardashian. Shortly after an introductory dinner with Madison, Victoria apparently told Brooklyn to break things off with her or be cut off from the family financially... Yeah, the source claimed Victoria didn't like Madison THAT much.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Hereâ€™s How Madison Beer Really Spends Her $16 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Madison claimed that none of this is true and that she and Brooklyn were never dating, she has been contradictory about a romance with him. While she said to BUILD that they were just friends, she did not deny the kiss caught on camera. While talking to a paparazzi at LAX, Madison claimed that she and Brooklyn were just kids having fun and that's why they kissed.</p><p>So, while we have conflicting information about what really went on between them, there's no doubt that there were some sparks flying between Brooklyn and Madison. So much so that Brooklyn has not been spotted anywhere near her since starting to date Nicola Peltz. On top of this, Madison does not follow Brooklyn on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>David Beckhamâ€™s Son Brooklyn Gets Trolled For Buying $10 Million Home With His FiancÃ©e</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rq3Doqqopl2Xsqa%2BjJqlnWWSp7ywt8uypWaalZi4qa3MrGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-most-costly-natural-disasters-in-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Costliest Natural Disasters in History</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-countries-where-christmas-is-banned.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>The Grinch Stole Christmas From These 10 Countries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
