After all, there truly are some famous people who are so good at what they do that it is hard to imagine them doing anything else or another performer making it bing in their place. In reality, however, most stars only make it big by the skin of their teeth which is why <a href=#>many celebrities almost gave up on their craft before they rose to fame</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that some celebrities have taken some surprising roads to stardom. For example, <a href=#>Emma Stone starred in a d-list “reality” show</a> before she became one of the biggest movie stars of her generation. Of course, just because the story of Stone’s ascent to stardom has some amusing chapters doesn’t mean that is the case for every famous person. For proof of that, all you have to do is look at the fact that Fergie’s music career almost didn’t happen due to a dark time in her life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Justin Bieber & Other Musicians Who Got Their Start On YouTube</a></span></p><h2 id=fergie-rsquo-s-amazing-accomplishments>Fergie’s Amazing Accomplishments</h2><p>Even though <a href=#>Fergie has remained busy in the years since she left the Black Eyed Peas</a>, many fans of the singer’s work with the group are unaware of that since she has mostly stayed out of the spotlight. For that reason, some people who are less familiar with Fergie’s career may not know how much the performer accomplished at the height of her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First able to rise to fame as a member of the Black Eyed Peas, Fergie contributed to hit songs like “I Gotta Feeling”, “Boom Boom Pow”, “My Humps”, “Where is the Love”, and “Imma Be”. After playing a major role in that group taking the music world by storm, Fergie went on to enjoy loads of success as a solo star. Most notably, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fergie released major hit songs</a> like “Big Girls Don’t Cry”, “Fergalicious”, “London Bridge”, and “Glamourous”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Member Of The Black Eyed Peas Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fergie-39-s-addiction-issues>Fergie's Addiction Issues</h2><p>In an ideal world, nobody would know what it feels like to battle addiction. Of course, this isn’t an ideal world and addiction is a scourge upon the planet that has taken the lives and potential of far many people. Amazingly enough, virtually all Black Eyed Peas fans have no idea that before she became a star, Fergie easily could have been one of the people who lost their battle with addiction.</p><p>In the past, Fergie has spoken about the fact that she battled addiction early in life. However, given the fact that Fergie has enjoyed years of international superstardom, it could be easy to overlook that revelation as nothing more than a simple piece of trivia about the star. However, when she spoke to a British publication called iNews, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fergie revealed how serious the consequences of her addiction issues were</a> in 2017, she put everything she accomplished into perspective.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Helped Robert Downey Jr. Battle His Addiction</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Fergie and everyone who cared about her, she was addicted to crystal methamphetamine before she became famous. The singer eventually was able to kick her habit but as Fergie explained during the aforementioned interview, she dealt with the after-effects of her addiction for a long time after she got clean.</p><p>“At my lowest point, I was [suffering from] chemically-induced psychosis and dementia. I was hallucinating on a daily basis. It took a year after getting off that drug for the chemicals in my brain to settle so that I stopped seeing things. I’d just be sitting there, seeing a random bee or bunny.” Of course, seeing a bee or bunny that isn’t there may sound sweet but Fergie’s off-kilter brain chemistry at the time made her believe the FBI, CIA, and a SWAT team were after her. Terrified by that prospect, Fergie sought refuge in a church.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They tried to kick me out, because I was moving down the aisles in this crazy way, as I thought there was an infrared camera in the church trying to check for my body. I bolted past the altar into a hallway and two people were chasing me. I remember thinking: ‘If I walk outside, and the SWAT team’s out there, I was right all along. But if they’re not out there, then it’s the drugs making me see things and I’m going to end up in an institution. And if it really is the drugs, I don’t want to live my life like this anymore, anyway.’ I walked out of the church; obviously, there was no SWAT team, it was just me in a parking lot. It was a freeing moment.”</p><p>Given that Fergie’s addiction issues were serious enough to have that kind of lasting effect on the singer, it seems very clear that she easily could have passed away if she wasn’t able to beat them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>20 Photos Of Fergie That Might Make Josh Duhamel Regret His Decision</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidnqqXnrJurcOdoJysmaS7brvVnqmdp6OaeqW%2B1KBkrquVYq%2BtrcKkZJ6xlZl6sbHArGScmaKasrN51qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blue-ivy-carter-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Is Jay Z And Beyonce's Daughter Already So Rich?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-why-fans-think-zoe-saldana-wont-be-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Fans Think Zoe Saldana Won't Be In Guardians Of The Galaxy 3</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
