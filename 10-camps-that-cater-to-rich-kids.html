Prices range from just under $2000 to over $25,000, for anywhere from 1 to 10 weeks and the camps are located all over the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fiji-shark-studies-camp-6-000-plus-airfare-for-24-days>Fiji Shark Studies Camp/&nbsp;&nbsp;$6,000 plus airfare for&nbsp;24-days</h2><p>via:newswatch.nationalgeographic.com</p><p>Open to high school kids who have their scuba certification, campers get to with swim bull, lemon and tiger sharks at Fiji's Shark Reef Marine Reserve.

Located near the picturesque Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, Stagedoor Manor has an impressive list of former campers including <a title="Zach Braff Net Worth" href=#>Zach Braff</a>, <a title="Natalie Portman Net Worth" href=#>Natalie Portman</a>, <a title="Robert Downey Jr. Net Worth" href=#>Robert Downey Jr.</a> and <a title="Lea Michele Net Worth" href=#>Lea Michele</a>. They can concentrate on anything from acting, dancing and singing to production, set decoration, lighting – anything to do with film and stage, including guidance from agents, managers and talent agents. The cost isn't as much as many others but it's also not in the Girl Scout camp price range either: $5,645 for a 3-week session.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=princess-prep-3-995-plus-airfare-for-7-days>Princess Prep/&nbsp;$3,995 plus airfare for 7 days</h2><p>Via: princess-prep.com</p><p>For many little girls, the princess fantasy is strong and unyielding. Limited to 7 to 9 year old girls, Princess Prep stresses drawing upon the positive qualities and etiquette of princesshood and applying them to whatever path they choose in real life. The campers stay in the Kensington & Chelsea borough, one of the ritziest districts in the UK, and tour many royal hotspots like the State Apartments that house <a title="Princess Diana Net Worth" href=#>Princess Diana's</a> dress collection, as well as ride horses in Hyde Park, tour the Tower of London, marvel at the glory of the Crown Jewels and Buckingham Palace, and see a production at the theater in London's West End. The cost is quite extravagant as well: $3995 plus airfare for 7days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Yrq680maroZmkYrCiwMSrZK2nXae2pLSMpKCdq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-celebrities-who-broke-down-crying-on-tv.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Celebrities Who Broke Down Crying On TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vanderpump-rules-season-10-everything-to-know-so-far.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Vanderpump Rules' Season 10: Everything to Know So Far</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
