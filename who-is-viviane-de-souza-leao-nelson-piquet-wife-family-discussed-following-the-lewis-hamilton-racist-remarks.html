However, netizens have been curious about her since her spouse has been in the headlines today.</p><p>She may be his wife, but she is not the first one in Piquet’s life. Piquet’s first marriage was to Maria Clara. He tied the knot with her in 1976, which lasted only one year. However, they welcomed their only child, Geraldo Piquet, during that time.</p><p>Later, he married Dutchwoman Sylvia Tamsma, from whom he had three children.

Together, they have two children: Pedro Estacio Piquet and Marco Piquet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nelson-piquet-wife-viviane-de-souza-leao-age-net-worth-explored></span>Nelson Piquet Wife Viviane De Souza Leao Age & Net Worth Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nelson Piquet’s wife, Viavane De Souza, remains away from the limelight.

She was born in Goiânia, but when she was a year old, her family moved to the nation’s capital to begin a new life.</p><p>She began studying business administration but dropped out after accepting a position at an advertising agency. She tried to align both her studies and profession but was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, she could not refuse the chance to work in a field she enjoyed.</p><p>However, after the birth of her two children, it is not revealed whether she continued her work or not. Thus, the information on her net worth remains secret, but her husband is a millionaire.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-kids-does-nelson-piquet-have></span>How Many Kids Does Nelson Piquet Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nelson Piquet is a father to seven kids.
