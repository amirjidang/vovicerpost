The show features big names such as Jim Parsons, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaley Cuoco</a>, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first&nbsp;season in 2007 was okay-ish, or so fans claim! But after that, it went from flop to top.&nbsp;Three&nbsp;years into the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayim Bialik</a> joined the cast as neuroscientist Amy Fowler. She can best be described as a bridge between the geeks and the "normal" people.</p><p>By that time, the show was a huge success, and the Cuoco, Galecki, and Parsons had gone from making about $60,000 an episode to making $200,000 per episode. So, there's your first clue as to the "issues" that might have arisen between Cuoco and Bialik.</p><p>As the show progressed, rumors of "disagreements" between&nbsp;Kaley and Mayim began to surface.&nbsp;So, what really went on between the two? Let's have a look and see.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's Why Fans Secretly Disliked This 'Big Bang Theory' Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on August 7th, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong>&nbsp;Big Bang Theory has cemented itself as one of the best sitcoms, however, much like most shows, rumors of feuds and salary negotiations came about. The story surrounding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaley Cuoco's alleged feud with Mayim Bialik</a> began when the real-life neurophysicist joined the series in its third season. The two were allegedly at each other's throats, so much that producers had to keep them apart. Mayim also reportedly had an issue with the main cast members' salary, however, it was all later debunked as untrue. Despite the rumors being false, fans still wanted to know if Kaley and Mayim were friends in real life. Well, while they aren't besties, the two keep in touch and remain friendly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayim even attended Kaley's wedding!</a></p><h2 id=big-bang-theory-feuds-amp-resentments>'Big Bang Theory'&nbsp;Feuds & Resentments?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the course of the show's twelve-year run, new nerds and normal folk were added to the mix. One of these was Mayim Bialik as neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler.</p><p>When she joined the show in 2010, Cuoco, Galecki, and Jim Parsons had just negotiated a deal that bumped their salaries up from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$60,000 to $200,000 per episode</a>, sparking what could've been the start of a possible negotiation war with some of the cast newbies.</p><p>Now, gossip sites were all over the fact that Mayim Bialik resented the amount of money Cuoco made. In&nbsp;2018,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online</a>&nbsp;reported that Cuoco and Bialik were on such bad terms that the "producers tried to keep them apart on the set". Yikes!</p><p>According to an inside source, “Kaley and Mayim hated each other. There had been huge catfights between the two of them and producers tried to just keep them apart.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Only thing was, by that time Kaley and Mayim's characters were friends and spent time together. So just how did the whole distancing thing work?</p><p>According to a number of sources, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaley did not like Mayim at all!</a> But Radar Online had that covered too, saying,&nbsp;“Mayim is actually very cool and doesn’t understand why Kaley hates her. She has tried several times to make peace but it has never worked. Now she just tries to stay away.”</p><p>Apparently, the show was a hotbed of "icy feuds" where new cast members resented the $1 million an episode Cuoco, Galecki, and Parsons were getting. They even had a deal to take a cut on the "back end" of the show, essentially a share in the profits.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Say 'Big Bang Theory' Left A Plot Hole With Priya</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-boring-truth>The Boring Truth</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gossip Cop</a>&nbsp;was all over&nbsp;Radar Online&nbsp;about the story, saying that the publication&nbsp;picked up the story from a dodgy blog, rendering it completely untrue. In addition to their feud being a rumor, it was also proven that Mayim Bialik never resented Cuoco's salary.</p><p>As&nbsp;Gossip Cop&nbsp;pointed out, there was a&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;article in February of 2017 that reported that more senior cast members like Cuoco took a "pay cut to free up money for raises for Bialik..." and others. So, if the cast was taking pay cuts, it's clear they didn't mind the newbies making some more coin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Variety&nbsp;went on to say,&nbsp;“The move is evidence of the strong camaraderie among the key players on the show.” It went on to claim that the “general harmony behind the scenes has also contributed to the show’s enduring creative strength.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Big Bang Theory Fans Think This Is The Moment The Show Died</a></span></p><h2 id=are-mayim-amp-kaley-friends-in-real-life>Are Mayim & Kaley Friends In Real Life?</h2><p>Says Mayim Bialik about her and Kaley's relationship:&nbsp;"We worked together for nine years, and I went to her wedding and celebrated things with her – I would say we’re friends." Kaley agreed with that statement, plain and simple. To back that up, we should note that they have both posted little mini-tributes to each other on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, the bond between the whole cast has remained strong. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>,&nbsp;all of the actors have remained friendly, "meeting for mini-reunions". Some are even working on projects together.</p><p>So, despite "certain sites" trying to stir up feuds and controversies, it appears that the cast of&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory&nbsp;got on just fine, thank you. That would include Mayim Bialik and Kaley Cuoco.</p><p>We know. We know. It's more fun to talk about "catfights" and "feuds" and "hate". But the truth? Mayim and Kaley did (and do) get on just fine.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Controversial Sheldon And Leonard Scene 'Big Bang Theory' Was Forced To Cut</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGavlaPBbrvNZpmerKeasq95zJqwoqVdl7aiuMikZJqmlGK4orjEsmScrZ%2BYvHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./when-does-baddies-east-auditions-come-out-june-release-date-announced.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>When Does Baddies East Auditions Come Out?
