After marrying Daryl Sabara, the Spy Kid, and diving into TikTok, Meghan had something of a resurgence. Not that she ever went away, necessarily, but <a href=#>her friendship with TikToker Chris Olsen</a> seemed to have cemented her in the influencer generation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though some of Meghan's recent hits went viral on TikTok, not all of her songs make an appearance on the platform. At least, they don't with Meghan singing them. It turns out that in addition to being a masterful songwriter, performer, and all-around relatable role model, Meghan's also an acclaimed songwriter to stars even bigger than she is.</p><h2 id=meghan-trainor-has-written-songs-for-many-high-profile-artists>Meghan Trainor Has Written Songs For Many High-Profile Artists</h2><p>'All About That Bass' was a massive hit for Meghan Trainor, but since those days, she's dabbled in a few other aspects of the music industry.</p><p>Sure, <a href=#>she's been busy racking up awards and going on a solo tour</a>, but she's also spent time writing songs for other artists.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify lists 104 songs written by Meghan</a>, including a few for lesser-known artists like Evvie McKinney and Lauren Alaina. But she's also benefited from millions of streams on Spotify (not to mention other platforms) for stars like John Legend, Rascal Flatts, Fifth Harmony, Sabrina Carpenter, Little Mix, and Jennifer Lopez.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Daryl Sabara's Real Feelings About Having More Kids With Meghan Trainor">Daryl Sabara's Real Feelings About Having More Kids With Meghan Trainor</a></span></p><p>That's not including the songs that Meghan has also appeared on; she has songwriting credits on collabs with Jason Mraz, Jason Derulo, Sean Paul, DJ Khaled, Wiz Khalifa, and others.</p><p>With her star-studded songwriting resume, it's not surprising that <a href=#>Trainor is worth $10 million</a>, and she's showing no signs of slowing down.</p><h2 id=what-song-did-meghan-trainor-write-for-rascal-flatts>What Song Did Meghan Trainor Write For Rascal Flatts?</h2><p>A lot of Meghan Trainor's collaborations today are with big-name stars or social media personalities. But her road to fame was paved with stars, and she seemed to rub elbows with influential groups early on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One example is her 2015 release with Rascal Flatts; the song "I Like the Sound of That" came out in September with Meghan Trainor listed as one of its songwriters (the others credited include Jesse Frasure and Shay Mooney of Dan + Shay).</p><p>The song reached number one on some country charts and ranked on multiple Billboard lists, but it didn't necessarily gain traction because of Meghan. At that time, she was a pop debutante, so a country song credit probably didn't have a huge impact on fans' perceptions (or her own song sales).</p><p>But it probably led to other opportunities to pen lyrics for other artists, in various genres.</p><h2 id=which-song-did-meghan-trainor-write-for-jlo>Which Song Did Meghan Trainor Write For JLo?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jennifer-lopez-in-the-wedding-planner-via-youtube-sony-pictures-entertainment-channel.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Jennifer Lopez released "Ain't Your Mama," a song that, unfortunately, was highly forgettable when compared to some of JLo's more famous tracks. But the song was written by Meghan along with five other writers.</p><p>One of those writers was "Dr. Luke," AKA Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, who was, around that time, dragged by Kesha. <a href=#>The artist sued Gottwald for emotional distress</a>, among other accusations. However, despite being released in 2016, JLo's song wasn't written after Kesha's lawsuit. E! Online<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recapped the songwriting timeline</a>, pointing out that Meghan wrote the song "years ago" and that Luke produced it prior to Kesha coming forward.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Meghan Trainor Inks Overall Deal With NBC Universal To Develop Cross Network Entertainment">Meghan Trainor Inks Overall Deal With NBC Universal To Develop Cross Network Entertainment</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though some critics were unhappy about the Dr. Luke-JLO-Meghan Trainor connection, E! clarified that JLo never worked in the studio with Gottwald. Backlash wasn't too severe, and while the song made it to number eight on iTunes, it was soon ousted by Meghan's own "No," which hit number four.</p><h2 id=who-other-songs-has-meghan-written>Who Other Songs Has Meghan Written?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sabrina-Carpenter---Skin.jpg><p>E! Online pointed out that JLo's "Ain't Your Mama" had similar themes to Meghan's previous "Dear Future Husband," which made sense given the artist worked on it. But does the same apply to other tracks?</p><p>Meghan also wrote two songs for Sabrina Carpenter; "Darling I'm a Mess" with Lily Harrington and "Can't Blame a Girl for Trying" with two other writers (the album Eyes Wide Open debuted in 2015).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both songs are definitely more Sabrina's style than Meghan's when compared to the latter's biggest hits, but some of the lyrics do hint at her influence.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Sabrina Carpenter's New Song Suggests The Olivia Rodrigo Love Triangle Never Even Happened">Sabrina Carpenter's New Song Suggests The Olivia Rodrigo Love Triangle Never Even Happened</a></span></p><p>Trainor's song for Little Mix, "You Gotta Not," may not be as well-known (nor as controversial as many of Sabrina's songs), but it's also a claim to fame for the singer-songwriter; she's also performed with Fifth Harmony as well as written songs for them.</p><p>And those songs might be a bit more in line with Trainor's style; Little Mix's "You Gotta Not" is again reminiscent of "Dear Future Husband" and other tracks by Meghan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lyrics, "Call your momma "mommy" (you gotta not!)/Askin' her for money (you gotta not!)/Never keep your house clean (you gotta not!)/Wearin' dirty laundry (you gotta not!)/Is that what you call flirtin'? (you gotta not!)/You ain't even workin', boy get a job" clearly sound like something Meghan would add to a song.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddna60ecyenqGZnmLBs63Ip6arZaentrXAxKdkrKeenMBuss6rZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-turchin-wiki-net-worth-age-husband-lance-bass-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Turchin Wiki, Net Worth, Age, Husband Lance Bass Birthday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./madison-iseman-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-13000-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Madison Iseman Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
