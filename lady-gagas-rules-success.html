A group of cruel NYU classmates even created a Facebook page dedicated to mocking her dreams of becoming a famous singer.</p><p>Now, Lady Gaga routinely speaks about the importance of self-love and staying true to yourself. Just one exampleâ€”"At the end of the day, you won't be happy until you love yourself," Lady Gaga <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> during a speech. Inspiring words from Mother Monster!</p><h2 id=she-takes-risks>She Takes Risks</h2><p>From wearing dresses made entirely of meat, to staying in a huge egg-like vessel for 72 hours before her 2011 Grammy <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">performance</a>, Gaga has made a name for herself by pushing the boundaries of fashion, music, and the public imagination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gaga took another risk when, in 2016, she traded her high-fashion image and art haus sound for a stripped-down, 1970's soft-rock aesthetic in Joanne. However, Lady Gaga's <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">readiness</a> to take risks and continuously rethink her musical style and image has helped define her as an unstoppable creative force.</p><h2 id=she-values-her-family>She Values Her Family</h2><p>Its no secret that staying grounded is a formidable challenge for superstars. When you're shot into superstardom, extreme wealth, and constant surveillance in your early twenties, who can you rely on? Lady Gaga can fall back on her supportive family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Families in Show Business</a></span></p><p>The Germanotta family <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helps</a> Lady Gaga both with her musical career and her advocacy.

"No matter gay, straight or bi, lesbian, transgender life, I'm on the right track baby, I was born to be brave!" Lady Gaga, who is proudly <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bisexual</a>, sings on Born This Way, a track dedicated to self-liberation and empowerment.</p><h2 id=she-is-kind>She is Kind</h2><p>For Lady Gaga, kindness is not an afterthought but a guiding principle. Her dedication to remaining kind, considerate, and generous has made her a leader in philanthropy and hugely positive as a role model to her fans.</p><p>"We bring people together to have real, honest conversations and to be kind. It is not an afterthought to our work. It is the driving power for everything we do. It is the lens we view every challenge through. It is framing the way we put everything around every possible solution. To me, almost every problem you can think of can be solved with kindness," Gaga <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> as she received the Children Mending Heart's 10th annual Empathy Rocks awards for her work with the foundation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-breaks-boundaries>She Breaks Boundaries</h2><p>From her unique fashion choices to her genre-bending and blending music, Lady Gaga has never failed to excite her fans and capture the public imagination.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Emmys 2019: 5 Best Dressed & 5 Riskiest Outfits, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Her impact on the world of pop is profound.

Additionally,&nbsp;Lady Gaga's dedication to breaking boundaries and producing innovative music has made her an inspiration for many artists, including Nicki Minaj and Halsey.</p><h2 id=she-works-hard>She Works Hard</h2><p>"This is hard work," Gaga <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> as she accepted an Academy Award for Best Original Song. "I've worked hard for a long time, and it's not about winningâ€”but what it's about is not giving up."</p><p>"If you have a dream, fight for it," she continued. "There's a discipline for passion. And it's not about how many times you get rejected, or you fall, or you're beaten up. It's about how many times you stand up, and are brave, and you keep on going."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-persistent>She is Persistent</h2><p>After injuring herself during The Monster Ball tour, Gaga was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diagnosed</a> with synovitis, an inflammation of the joints, and a gruesome labral tear.
