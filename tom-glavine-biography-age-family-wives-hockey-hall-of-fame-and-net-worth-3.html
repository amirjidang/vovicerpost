Besides, they are also parents of an adopted son, Kienan Patrick.</p><p>However, it is not his only marriage. As a matter of fact, he was formerly married to Carri Ann Dobbins since 1992.

Nevertheless, his parents buy him skates as soon as he gets old enough.</p><p>Furthermore, they were funned of bringing him to the rink to skate. Besides, he’d go over to the pond down the street or to Nuttings Lake. Moreover, he had a hockey stick in his hand, whether it for ice hockey or the many street games on the weekends from early morning until dark.</p><p>By the time he starts playing against Chelmsford, however, it is the game. The play was spirited. Beating Chelmsford usually meant winning the Merrimack Valley Conference and going to face off somewhere down the road in the state hockey tournament. These intense rivalry games were some of the most memorable of my youth.</p><p>“In a February 20, 1984, game,” he says, “I got off the quickest goal I ever scored. It was early in the game and the faceoff was in the Chelmsford end. I played center and I was facing off against Jon Morris, who was always battling me for the top-scorer spot. As soon as the ref dropped the puck, I snared the puck and shot it in one motion and it flew past their goalie. We took a 1–0 lead and went on to win 4–0.”</p><p>He remembers their coach, Jack Fletcher, saying afterward, “He’s unbelievably quick. I’ve never seen anyone do that to Jon. He’s the class of the league.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tom-glavine-mets></span><strong>Tom Glavine Mets</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2003, Glavine leaves Atlanta to play for the rival New York Mets. Citing this, he signs a four-year, $42.5 million deal.<br>His performance, however, slumps in the second half of 2002 and he gets ineffective in his two postseason starts. Due to this, Atlanta refuses to guarantee the third year on his contract.</p><p>Furthermore, his first year as a Met was poor. For the first time since 1988, Glavine fails to win 10 games, also posting his first losing record in that span, 9–14.</p><p>Besides, he also allows his first career grand slam, hit by José Vidro of the Expos on September 19. Glavine does not enjoy a personal highlight at the end of the season. However, when the Mets call up his brother Mike to join the team, He begins to well up.</p><p>Nonetheless, he starts off 2005 slowly but rebounds after advice from pitching coach Rick Peterson. He encourages him to begin pitching inside more often (including a change-up) and incorporate a curveball in his repertoire.</p><p>Most noteworthy, this turnaround helps him earn National League Pitcher of the Month in September. He finishes the season with a 13–13 record and a respectable 3.53 ERA.</p><p>Prior to this, he finishes the 2006 season with a fine 15–7 record and a 3.82 ERA, as the Mets win the National League Eastern Division. This allows him to make his first playoff appearance since leaving the Braves.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tom-glavine-hall-of-fame></span><strong>Tom Glavine Hall Of Fame</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He never lits up the radar gun, so opposing batters often come to the plate anticipating a good at-bat. However, in most cases, these same batters trudge right back to the dugout. Hence, victimized by a steely-eyed strike-thrower who overwhelms the opponents with control and determination rather than speed.</p><p>Glavine, whose 305 victories surpasses by only three other left-handers in history, is now on his way to the Hall of Fame.</p><p>Nevertheless, the letters in both ice hockey and baseball in high school. He gets a select in the fourth round of the 1984 National Hockey League entry draft by the Los Angeles Kings.</p><p>However, he decides to choose baseball when the Braves tabs him with a second-round pick that same year.</p><p>Most importantly, he becomes well known for his calm demeanor on the mound. In addition to this, his dogged refusal to give in to batters. Moreover, Glavine paints the outside corner with pitch after pitch, hence, expanding the strike zone ever so slightly throughout the game.</p><p>Furthermore, he walks 1,500 career batters because he does not throw pitches down the middle of the plate. This applies even when he is behind in the count.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tom-glavine-atlanta-braves></span><strong>Tom Glavine Atlanta Braves</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Glavine rejoins the Braves on November 18, 2007. Besides, he seemingly brings his career full circle, with a 1-year contract worth $8 million.</p><p>Nonetheless, he wins his first game with the Atlanta Braves since September 19, 2002, which is also his 304th win. It occurs while the Atlanta Braves are playing against the Philadelphia Phillies. Coincidentally, both his win on September 19, 2002, and May 14, 2008, are against the Phillies.</p><p>Prior to this, Glavine appears in his final game on August 14, 2008. He starts against the Chicago Cubs and gives up 7 runs in only 4 innings. A few days later, however, he is placed on the disabled list because of a recurring shoulder injury.</p><p>Most noteworthy, he agrees to return to Atlanta by signing a $1 million, one-year contract on February 19, 2009. In addition, the contract includes another $3.5 million in possible bonuses based on roster time.</p><p>However, the Braves releases Glavine on June 3, 2009, as he completes his rehab assignment. On June 20, he announces that he will not be pitching for the rest of the season.</p><p>He officially retires from the sport on February 11, 2010. Furthermore, he agrees to take a job as a special assistant to Braves president John Schuerholz.</p><p>The Braves retires Glavine’s # 47 on August 6, 2010.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tom-glavine-net-worth></span><strong>Tom Glavine Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He sits at an approximate net worth of $ 80 million and this alone speaks volumes about his accomplishments.
