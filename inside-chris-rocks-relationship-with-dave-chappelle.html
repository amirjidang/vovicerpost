This includes why exactly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he claims he's really unapproachable</a> and how he's struggled with various personality issues all of his life. Chris elaborated on this while speaking with Howard Stern on his iconic SiriusXM radio show. This is where he said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he got revenge on his high school bully</a>. On top of this, he also went into detail about his relationship with Dave Chappelle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like Chris Rock, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Chappelle is known as one of the most successful and influential comedians</a> of his age. This means that Dave and Chris could easily be competitive with one another, especially since there often feels as though there's limited space for comedians of color. But this is the furthest of the truth.</p><p>Let's get into what the dynamic is actually like between these two icons of comedy.</p><h2 id=chris-made-an-effort-to-make-sure-he-and-dave-got-along>Chris Made An Effort To Make Sure He And Dave Got Along</h2><p>Among Chris' many revealing stories he shared with Howard Stern was his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comments about his relationship with Dave Chappelle</a>.</p><p>Due to the small space that Black comedians get to play in, Chris Rock felt that it was important that he and a comedian he often gets compared to become friends and allies. This was especially important given the fact that other major Black comedians of the past didn't quite see eye-to-eye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I realized [Bill] Cosby and Richard Pryor did not get along," Chris told Howard, referring to the completely different styles and life perspectives that groundbreaking comedian Richard Pryor and now-disgraced comedian Bill Cosby had. "Richard and Eddie [Murphy] didn’t get along, so I made it a f***ing conscious effort—me and Dave Chappelle are going to get along."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Everyone Dave Chappelle Is Friends With (And His Foes)</a></span></p><p>The two have built a pretty dynamic relationship in their private life. They consider each other to be good friends and they both spend time together socially, with other friends and on their own.</p><p>On top of this, Dave Chapelle got Chris to open up to him while Chris was going through a heated divorce and custody battle. He straight-up asked him if he cried, and answering that question made Chris feel like it was okay that a man cries, especially during such a traumatic situation.</p><p>But their connection is beyond a personal one...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris Rock has also championed Dave Chappelle throughout his career and was particularly supportive when Dave started his major comeback in 2017 after a long vacation from the industry.</p><h2 id=dave-and-chris-love-doing-shows-together>Dave And Chris Love Doing Shows Together</h2><p>Not only did Chris Rock champion Dave Chappelle's 2017 comeback from the sidelines, he also invited him up on stage with him... Or, rather, let Dave crash his gigs. According to The Independent, Dave Chappelle randomly joined Chris Rock on stage at multiple gigs during Chris' Total Blackout tour.</p><p>This wasn't a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo, it was a full-on appearance. In fact, Dave would just end up hanging out with Chris on stage.</p><p>During Chris' October 2020 interview on SiriusXM's The Howard Stern Show, he went into more detail:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There was like a couple shows that were just me and Dave on stage for like two hours. He would call up my road manager, like, ‘I’m coming.' And we'd set it up for him. And literally, him and I would come on stage together. We'd just riff. We'd get on one topic and he'd do his version of it and I'd do my version of it. And we'd tag on each other's lines. It's like Jay-Z and Kanye when they're on tour together."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock Identifies The Struggles Of The Black Community In Terms Of Rich Vs. Wealth</a></span></p><p>"Standing there while the other guy's killing and f***ing like screw you up," Howard said in the interview. "No?"</p><p>"I dunno, I'm just not at that point right now," Chris responded. "I'm secure with my spot. I feel like a made-man. You know what I mean?"</p><p>"Yeah. You're an elder statesman."</p><p>"And I just love Dave," Chris said affectionately. "We're just collaborating. And when we're on stage together and he's being funny, I'm being funny. And when I'm being funny, he's being funny."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Independent, the audience just goes crazy to see these two together. Therefore, it's safe to say that what Chris is describing is completely accurate.</p><h2 id=collaborating-during-covid>Collaborating During COVID</h2><p>Given that Howard Stern is particularly germaphobic, he had to question Chris about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appearing at comedy clubs with Dave Chappelle during COVID</a>.</p><p>Dace Chappelle has been hosting socially distanced comedy shows at a club in Ohio that has included the likes of Chris Rock and Jim Carrey. Everyone is constantly tested and the event adheres to strict guidelines.</p><p>The whole thing was set up to bring a bit of joy into people's lives but also because Dave and Chris both have a ceaseless desire to perform... and not just alone... No way, they want to entertain the masses together.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Dave Chappelle And Joe Rogan?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp6uZmbJur8eroKxloqSwrL%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZq%2BZqbVusMCvnGabmJa9sbHLpZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrea-greene.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Andrea Greene Real Person?
