I deal with it every single day. Screaming all day. Yelling all day. Losing his mind all day. Taking my belongings. It’s just, enough is enough.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kim-Zolciak-Biermann-Was-Devastated-She-Missed-Kroy-Biermann-Divorce-Hearing.jpg><p>Though officers attempted to speak with Biermann, he refused to come out of the room and denied having his estranged wife’s phone, claiming he didn’t know where it was.</p><p>The reality personality also noted that nothing physical occurred between her and the NFL alum that night, according to the outlet, who also reported that since Zolciak-Biermann couldn’t show authorities a copy of the court order, nothing could be done about the domestic disturbance.</p><p>The incident is just the latest in the ongoing drama between the estranged spouses.</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly confirmed</a> in February last year that the duo’s Georgia mansion was in foreclosure, and there was an auction slated for the following month. Zolciak-Biermann previously denied that she was having legal trouble in 2022.</p><p>Though the auction was canceled, Truist Bank submitted additional documents to the court in April as a push for the couple to accelerate their repayment plan after defaulting on their mortgage and struggling to find a buyer for their home, according to documents <a href=#>obtained by Us</a> at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A <a href=#>foreclosure notice</a> doesn’t necessarily mean that the <a href=#>Don’t Be Tardy</a> stars and their family would be forced out of their home right away, but it may signify that Truist Bank is upping its legal claim over the outstanding debt.</p><p>Amid the foreclosure drama, Zolciak-Biermann and Biermann’s marriage crumbled. The pair <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in May 2023 after 11 years of marriage. They briefly reconciled but Biermann filed for a second time that August.</p><p>Together, the exes share six children: Brielle, 27, and Ariana, 22, Zolciak-Biermann’s children from previous relationships, whom Biermann later adopted, as well as sons Kroy “KJ” Jr., 12, and Kash, 11, and twins Kaia and Kane, 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1ix7C4wqKYpGWTlrmtv4yppqWhk5p6sLqMnqqtqpGjtKawjKGsrJqRo7Fut9GosGaamZq%2Frq3Np2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./koo-bon-neung-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Koo Bon-Neung Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-is-the-face-of-dolce-gabbanas-new-campaign.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Is The Face Of Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbanas New Campaign</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
