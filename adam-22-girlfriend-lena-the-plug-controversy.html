Throughout the years, the couple faced controversies, but both proved their love towards each other. So what do fans really think about her?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appears as though not a day goes by without a popular social media personality either making controversial comments or being accused of past actions. Many of them were once loved, but there is only so much controversy that a person can generate before their followers turn on them. Adam 22 and his partner Lena The Plug are no exception, as issues continue to linger around their relationship.</p><p><strong>Updated on May 22, 2023: </strong>While nothing has been confirmed, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">rumors are beginning to spread that Lena the Plug and Adam 22 are on rocky ground</a>. With the Lena's popularity consistently on the rise and Adam's hitting more of a decline, she has now overshadowed his career.</p><p>We do not know if this means she will end up leaving him to find someone more successful or if she will stay with him since they have been together for so long and share a child together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The 9 Biggest Controversies Of Logan Paul</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-lena-the-plug>Who Is Lena The Plug?</h2><p>Lena, whose real name is Lena Nersesian, has not taken what many perceive to be the conventional way of reaching the top. Nevertheless, she has found great success within a short period. Over time, she has found a way to appeal to the desires of her fans – and that has been the secret behind her escalating brand.</p><p>But becoming an internet sensation was tricky ground, as Lena was raised by very strict Christian parents. She graduated from the University of California and got a degree in Psychology. The influencer entered grad school, but was not able to finish due to financial problems. So, she started working at a social media startup – where her co-workers began to give her a nickname “Lena The Plug.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lena-the-plug-q-a-youtube-video.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aware that the job was not a great for her, she started working as a Snapchat model and gradually her fans increased. Now, she has over a million followers on YouTube and earns a handful of money – just as how other personalities became famous because of this platform.</p><p>In an interview with Forbes, she shared, “I only got into this business because so many followers kept asking me if I had premium content. Now I use my social media platforms as marketing tools for my business. And as a way to meet the other creators to work with. I owe everything to the internet and these platforms.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Biggest YouTube Dramas Of 2022</a></span></p><h2 id=how-is-lena-the-plug-and-adam-22-rsquo-s-relationship-doing>How Is Lena The Plug And Adam 22’s Relationship Doing?</h2><p>The couple started dating in 2016 and have been together for years now. Both of them also appear on each other’s YouTube channels. Though they are in a “semi-open relationship,” they welcomed their firstborn in 2020 and recently got engaged as well. Adam posted a vlog on his channel in which he surprised Lena with a romantic trip to Malibu and put a very exquisite diamond ring on her finger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amidst the controversy and allegations, Lena and Adam proved that they can build a happy family. Many sent their congratulatory messages to the couple while others shared their opinions regarding their relationship. One fan commented on the post, “Happy to see more positive comments than the usual negative ones.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/adam-22-and-lena-the-plug.jpg><h2 id=what-do-fans-really-think-about-lena-the-plug>What Do Fans Really Think About Lena The Plug?</h2><p>After sharing the big announcement on Twitter and posting the video on YouTube, Adam’s followers flocked to the comment section to congratulate the couple. One commented, “Lena is such a good person and absolutely deserves to be the mom and wife she's always wanted to be. Adam seemed like a s**t boyfriend the first couple years but you can tell she's changed him for the better. It's nice to see.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another chimed in, “Lena said ‘I didn’t expect to cry’ and I was thinking the same thing as my eyes teared up lol I’ve been watching Lena since day one and your guy’s relationship journey and the growth you’ve both had. You guys have a special bond and a love that is once in a lifetime. I’m so happy for you both and I wish you all of the love and joy with your beautiful family.”</p><p>While many genuinely celebrated with them, others posted their supposed concern about it. One wrote, “Hello Adam. How about asking your wife to stop p**n? Think about the baby..she will get bullied so hard in school she will commit suicide.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lena-the-plug-and-adam-22.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the reactivities, many believe that the family of three will get through this. A fan commented on YouTube, “Good for you Adam, stepping up and doing those good Man choices. You are influencing these young folk how to properly step up and be a man and asking the woman you love more then anything in the world to marry you. Congratulations to the three of you.”</p><p>Another shared, “Congratulations mate! She's definitely a keeper! Definitely one of the realest couples on YouTube! Good luck for the future!” With that, many want them not only engaged but get married soon and not end up like other celebrity couples who end up splitting before tying the knot. Whatever the fans think about Lena The Plug and Adam 22, only time will tell what future they will have!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZmdYn9zecaiqaWeop6yr7CMpZynmV2ptaZ5z6WsoGWTpLu1vs6vnKurqWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./travel-to-europe-checklist.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Travel To Europe Checklist: All The Essentials You Need</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-voices-ashley-bryant-engaged-tom-nitti-proposes-before-audition.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Voices Ashley Bryant Engaged, Tom Nitti Proposes Before Audition</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
