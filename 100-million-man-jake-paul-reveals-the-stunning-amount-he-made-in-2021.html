He followed the successful bout by defeating Tyron Woodley twice, later in the year.</p><p>The boxer received a purse just for showing up to the fight, but most of his profit was generated from his share of the pay-per-view purchases.</p><p>"That is just what I made from boxing," Paul said of the $40 million he made in the ring.
