<strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview with TIME Magazine released this month, Taylor addressed the incident for one of the first times in a decade, admitting she was once worried it would end her career.</p><p>The singer described <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the public’s reaction to the drama as “a career death”</a> and admits it “took [her] down psychologically to a place [she’d] never been before.”</p><p>“Make no mistake — my career was taken away from me,” Taylor explained. “You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar.”</p><p>“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before,” Taylor went on. “I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim hasn’t directly responded to Taylor’s claims that she edited the audio clip, but Swifties haven’t been shy to call her out online.</p><p>During a post to her Instagram page, where she has 364 million followers, Kim promoted her billion-dollars SKIMS fans. But rather than rave about her new products, many fans commented on Kim, Kanye, and Taylor’s feud, with some calling for the reality tar to finally apologize to Swift.</p><h2 id=swifties-flooded-kim-rsquo-s-instagram-account-demanding-an-apology>Swifties Flooded Kim’s Instagram Account Demanding An Apology</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screen-shot-2023-10-04-at-11-07-24-am.png><p>"Kim what you did to Tay affected her mental health.
