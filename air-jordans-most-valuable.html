They are now high-priced statement pieces that are very carefully selected by each individual, and often added to a collection of other Air Jordan’s. These prized possessions are treated more like memorabilia than mere shoes to be worn for the day. Collectors all over the world are known to seek out specific types of Air Jordan shoes, and are willing to pay a very high price to gain ownership of them. The high demand for these shoes continues to add to their overall value and the cost continues to rise. Let’s explore the 10 Most Valuable Air Jordan’s Ever Made…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=air-jordan-ii-blackout---11-267>Air Jordan II Blackout - $11,267</h2><p>The Air Jordan 11 Blackout sold for the staggering price of $11,267. This is one of the most popular editions of the brand, with the all-black design being a real hit with customers across the globe. This shoe is a cross between a slick, all-black high-end shoe, and an athletic running shoe that will be as functional as it is aesthetically attractive. Our guess is that this shoe would be purchased and cherished on display as part of a museum-like collection, rather than worn on the court.</p><h2 id=air-jordan-vi-1992-olympics-edition---7-200>Air Jordan VI 1992 Olympics Edition - $7,200</h2><p>With a price tag of $7,200, the Air Jordan VI 1992 Olympics edition easily ranks as one of the 10 Most Expensive Air Jordan Sneakers. The value of this shoe comes from the fact that Jordan was one of the very few basketball stars to earn an Olympic Gold Medal.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Air Jordan 12 'Light Aqua" To Be Available For Women And Girls</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, at the time of the win- this is the shoe he wore on his feet. This pair was specially designed for him for this occasion and the idea of wearing this piece of history drives the cost of the shoe to soaring heights.</p><h2 id=air-jordan-v-se---10-000>Air Jordan V (SE) - $10,000</h2><p>If you’d like to purchase a pair of 1990’s Air Jordan V (SE), you’ll have to be willing to drop at least $10,000. This incredible design was inspired by the fighter planes which were used in World War II, as they had the image of the mouth of a shark painted across the nose of the aircraft. It’s no wonder that this historic significance and elaborate design added to the value of this stunning shoe. This particular shoe also features lace locks and was the first of its kind at the time. It’s easy to see how this shoe would not only gain popularity but also sustain its value over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=air-jordan-1-black-and-gold---25-000>Air Jordan 1 (Black and Gold) -&nbsp;$25,000</h2><p>The Air Jordan 1 (Black and Gold) is easily one of the most famous Jordan designs of our time. It resonates with Jordan fans and has been so wildly popular around the world that it has been re-released several times since it was first introduced. The black and metallic gold version of this shoe is the rarest and subsequently the most expensive one in the lineup.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>DJ Khaled's Rare Air Jordan's (And 19 Other Celebs' Favourite Luxurious Sneakers</a></span></p><p>This particular shoe was an exclusive one, with only 12 pairs released into the mainstream market. If you happen to own a pair, you may struggle between proud ownership and willingness to sell, as they are now worth at least $25,000.</p><h2 id=the-air-jordan-2-og---31-000>The Air Jordan 2 OG - $31,000</h2><p>The Air Jordan 2 OG will set you back at least $31,000 if you’re interested in fighting for it on eBay. Unlike most of the other Jordan designs, this model wasn’t a big hit among consumers and failed to gain the traction that collectors were accustomed to. The reason – well, there wasn’t much to talk about. The shoes weren’t in great condition, nor were the styling elements of this sneaker impressive in any way. Given the historical significance of the shoe’s 28-year history, it would have been nice if the original owners had paid more attention to the overall care and preservation of this shoe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-air-jordan-10-ovo---20-000>The Air Jordan 10 OVO - $20,000</h2><p>The Air Jordan 10 OVO is a limited edition shoe with a huge price tag. Worth roughly $20,000, the popularity of this shoe was attributed to the hype surrounding the first person to own a pair – Drake himself. Drake is known to be a huge basketball fan, and when he was gifted this shoe, the world took notice. This was a great move by the brand, as the demand for this shoe sky-rocketed when Drake was seen in a pair.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Air Jordan 'Gym Red Sneaker' Release Date And Details</a></span></p><p>In true Drake fashion, he made sure every member in his crew also received a pair, to further emphasize his symbolic relationship with the Jordan brand. Drake caused a further fuss over this shoe by donating his pair to a fan- who by the way is now likely selling them for lots of money!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-air-jordan-1-1985-asg---21-780>The Air Jordan 1 (1985 ASG) - $21,780</h2><p>The Air Jordan 1 (1985 ASG) commands the price of $21,780. The story behind this shoe is an interesting one. It was worn in 1985 when Michael Jordan played in the NBA all-star game. He played against the likes of Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and Larry Bird, and sadly he did not play his best game. His performance at this match was far from his best, but the mere fact that he faced his opponents while wearing this shoe seemed to make it significant enough to attain significant value.</p><h2 id=air-jordan-12-flu-game---104-000>Air Jordan 12 (Flu Game) - $104,000</h2><p>During Game 5 of the NBA finals in 1997, Michael Jordan was feeling under the weather with the flu. Feeling ill didn’t count him out of the game though. He continued to push through and he managed to muster up 15 points in the last quarter, leading his team to a victorious ending.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Top 10 Coolest Air Jordans Of All Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was a historic moment that will never be forgotten, and apparently the world won’t ever forget the incredible shoes that were part of this magical experience. Worth a whopping $104,000, this autographed shoe is every collector’s dream. This particular shoe is the highest valued, most sought-after shoe in Jordan history, and we suspect its value to continue to climb higher with the passing of time.</p><h2 id=eminem-x-carhartt-x-air-jordan-4-retro---30-000>Eminem X Carhartt x Air Jordan 4 Retro - $30,000</h2><p>This shoe design took the world by storm. Designed to commemorate the 15th anniversary of Shady Records, this limited edition shoe features silver accents and Eminem’s branding throughout the shoe. The soles are fully translucent, and they created a bidding war when they were released to the public in 2015. The cost of these shoes is a jaw-dropping $ 30,000. While this may seem like a lot of money for a pair of shoes, the Eminem and Carhartt influence make them a priceless treasure to collectors and fans alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=air-jordan-silver-shoes---60-000>Air Jordan Silver Shoes - $60,000</h2><p>Next time you have $60,000 to spare, you can pick up a pair of extremely rare Air Jordan Silver Shoes. Actually, this is what they were sold for at auction, so perhaps you may want to add some padding to that $60k price tag so that you can bid on this shoe that will surely continue to increase in value. The unique qualities of this shoe lie in the fact that only 10 pairs were released when they were first introduced. The design was fresh, unique, and stylistic, and was a huge hit.</p><p>These limited-release shoes were as practical as they were durable, and shockingly, Michael Jordan never once slipped them onto his feet. The mere fact that he owned them but never adorned them added a level of mystery to the shoe, driving the value even higher. Michael received this shoe as a gift from his wife on his 32nd birthday – owning a pair of these shoes would be owning a piece of significant history.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Top 8 Surprising Facts About Air Jordans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKypobJwrcirZKOnopmur7%2BMpqasrF2rrq3BwJujnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-reasons-niykee-heaton-is-the-next-kim-kardashian.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Reasons Niykee Heaton Is The Next Kim Kardashian</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-celebs-who-went-broke.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Celebs Who Went From Rich To Broke</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
