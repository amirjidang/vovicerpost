From there, Coster-Waldau leaped to acting in America when he appeared in the film Black Hawk Down in a minor but important role. Following that initial success, Coster-Waldau’s career continued to take off with several roles in successful films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Game Of Thrones Cast: Current Ages, Relationship Statuses, & Net Worths</a></span></p><p>Of course, it was when Nikolaj Coster-Waldau joined the cast of Game of Thrones that his career really went to the next level. Largely thanks to his years bringing Jaime Lannister to life from 2011 until 2019, <a href=#>Coster-Waldau amassed a humongous $16 million fortune.</a> Given that Coster-Waldau has managed to become so wealthy, that begs an obvious question, how does the beloved actor spend his large fortune.</p><h2 id=nikolaj-coster-waldau-rsquo-s-fascinating-lifestyle>Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’s Fascinating Lifestyle</h2><p>Unlike a lot of stars, it has never seemed like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has been overly interested in playing the Hollywood game. Instead, it seems pretty clear that he has a passion for acting and that he hasn’t let fame go to his head since <a href=#>Coster-Waldau clearly gets along with his co-stars</a> and his fans alike. With that in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that Coster-Waldau has never seemed to be the kind of star who likes to flaunt his riches. However, that doesn’t mean that Coster-Waldau has been afraid to spend a lot of money to enjoy the lifestyle he desires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Things Most Fans Don't Know About The Game Of Thrones Couples BTS</a></span></p><p>Over the years, there have been several stars who’ve made a show about the massive amount of money they’ve spent to accumulate mind-blowing car collections. For example, virtually everyone knows that Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld have spent far more money on cars than most people will ever see in their entire lives. When it comes to Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, however, it is very clear that he will never amass a huge car collection. After all, Coster-Waldau’s main car for years after he became rich was a 2007 Skoda and he was spotted in an Audi F103 in that era.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, the actor bought a new Fisker Ocean SUV and he was so passionate about the vehicle that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau penned a Hollywood Reporter article about why he bought it</a>. As Coster-Waldau’s writing made clear, he is deeply concerned about climate change and believes that everyone should do what they can to fight against it. A firm believer that the Fisker Ocean SUV all-electric vehicle is good for the environment and affordable, Coster-Waldau explained that it costs “just under $40,000” in the article he wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>UPS Is Releasing Electric Trucks</a></span></p><p>When it comes to the home that Nikolaj Coster-Waldau owns, it seems pretty clear that he was willing to spend a small fortune. Since Coster-Waldau doesn’t seem to be a braggadocious person on any level, there doesn’t appear to be any publically available information about how much the actor spent to buy his Hollywood Hills home. However, what is clear is that after he made that purchase, Coster-Waldau spared no expense in his effort to make sure the home he shares with his wife and kids fits his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While speaking to architecturaldigest.com, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau explained the extensive work he had done to the home. With the help of interior designers Lonnie Castle and Birgitta Nellemann, Coster-Waldau had his home changed extensively. For example, Coster-Waldau completely overhauled the kitchen, fireplace, and so much more. As anyone who has financed home renovations should know, those kinds of expenses add up extremely quickly, to say the very least.</p><h2 id=nikolaj-coster-waldau-has-used-his-money-to-help-people-in-need>Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Has Used His Money To Help People In Need</h2><p>In a lot of ways, it is deeply silly that so many people seem to think of celebrities as being somehow better than everyone else. After all, stars are human beings just like the rest of us. However, some stars have used their platform and fortunes to improve the world including <a href=#>celebrities who’ve started their own charities</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities You Didn't Know Do Charity Work</a></span></p><p>As of the time of this writing, there is no indication that Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has started his own charity. However, it is very clear that Coster-Waldau has used his funds to support several charities and causes that the actor clearly cares deeply about.</p><p>According to looktothestars.org, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has donated to charities</a> like The FEED Foundation, International Rescue Committee, and United Nations Development Programme. On top of that, Coster-Waldau has used his funds to support causes like the fight against AIDS and HIV, helping people cope with poverty, aiding refugees, and several other extremely important issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Billy Porter Hailed As A Hero For Sharing His HIV Status With Fans</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiloqOfoa6recKoqq2domLEorjDmqysZZ6awW7DzquroWWRo7FutM6wZKGdXai9prrDrGSirF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-lowest-paid-quarterbacks-to-win-the-super-bowl.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Lowest-Paid Quarterbacks to Win the Super Bowl</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-top-10-richest-married-athlete-couples.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Top 10 Richest Married Athlete Couples</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
