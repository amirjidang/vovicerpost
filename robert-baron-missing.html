The Robert Baron family is still looking forward to the answers from the investigation committee.</p><p>Baron’s family hopes a video from the night he went missing may reveal the mystery behind his missing.&nbsp;Nicole, Baron’s daughter, is certain that she and her family are aware of who attacked her father.&nbsp;</p><p>The police investigation, particularly in the first stages of Baron’s disappearance, has drawn harsh criticism from Baron’s family.&nbsp;</p><p>On January 26, 2017, the night Robert Baron disappeared, this footage of two males walking near South Main Street in Old Forge near Ghigiarelli’s Restaurant was made public.</p><p>One man wearing shorts with a blurred face can be seen, while another man who is hidden in the shadows can be seen pulling what looks to be luggage in another video.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Nicole Baron, the luggage went missing from the apartment above Ghigiarelli’s.&nbsp;</p><p>Eyewitness <a href=#>News</a> questioned Nicole Baron about the connection between two people being seen lugging suitcases and a suitcase disappearing from her father’s building.&nbsp;</p><p>The family initially saw the footage in 2019, and it was first made public in 2018. Family members wonder why it did not contribute to the case’s arrest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“It creates suspicion whether they were involved or not. Therefore, They’re absolutely worth looking at and researching,”</strong> Nicole Baron said.</p><p>Lackawanna to County District Attorney Mark Powell stated, <strong>“The videos are part of our investigation, but I cannot speak precisely about who was interviewed or the specifics of the inquiry.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>“It’s nonstop torture for our family; we need answers.” </strong>Nicole Baron said, <strong>“We’re hoping that someone will come forward.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Robert Baron?</h2><p>Before he went missing, Robert Baron was seen dropping off his son in town on the evening on January 25, 2017.</p><p>Investigators discovered blood at his restaurant, and his automobile was located a mile away from the eatery a few days later. Blood was also discovered inside the car, along with mud on the tires.&nbsp;</p><p>Baron’s family claimed that there was no sign or hint of difficulty on the day he vanished.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2Bzpucq6xdl66zu81mpKKro567qHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./romeo-beckham.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Romeo Beckham News - Us Weekly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pictures-wow-wendy-williams-poses-nude-for-peta-20122911.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>PICTURES: Wow!
