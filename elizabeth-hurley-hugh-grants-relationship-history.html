Neither star seems to think twice about sharing what's on their minds or hearts, which results in some fascinating interviews. For example, <a href=#>Grant said he starred in Wonka for the money</a>, and he said that <a href=#>his appearance on The Daily Show was lackluster</a>. For her part, <a href=#>Hurley spilled about her co-star Brendon Fraser</a> after they appeared in Bedazzled together.</p><p>Since Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant always have so much to say, it's natural to be curious about what they really think about each other. According to Us Weekly, Hurley shared in April 2024 that she and Grant <strong>argued about the appearance of their hypothetical future kids</strong>.

They <strong>dated for 13 years from 1987 to 2000</strong>. According to Us Weekly, they went through a huge scandal in 1995 when <strong>Grant's affair with Divine Brown</strong>, a sex worker, became public. This was a very intense experience for both Hurley and Grant... and since they didn't break up right away, the rest of their relationship must have felt intense as well.</p><p>As The Guardian reported, Grant was arrested when seen with Brown in his car. After being told that he had to attend a program about AIDs and pay $1,000, he said that he and Hurley were going to stay together. He said, "I’ve done an abominable thing, and she’s [Liz Hurley] been amazing about it, and contrary to what I read in the paper today, she’s been very supportive, and we’re going to try to work it out.’’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hugh-grant-admitted-he-was-wrong-for-his-outburst-on-the-set-of-dungeons-and-dragons-but-what-really-happened_.jpg><p>Both actors have shared their perspectives on their breakup over the years and have opened up quite a lot to Andy Cohen.
