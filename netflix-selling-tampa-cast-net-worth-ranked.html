The show follows the lifestyles of some high-profile agents from Tampa Bay who close multimillion-dollar real estate listings before breakfast, so much so that it has become everyday life for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selling Tampa is a spin-off from a previously aired show called <a href=#>Selling Sunset,</a> and fans who followed the latter can testify that real estate sale is a pretty lucrative line of work. While their clients have been known to be extremely wealthy, the realtors aren't doing bad for themselves at all. If they earn millions in commission from closing one transaction, we can only wonder how much money they actually have. Here are the richest cast members of the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Ladies Of 'Selling Sunset' Ranked From Oldest To Youngest</a></span></p><h2 id=sharelle-rosado---6-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sharelle Rosado - $6 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We can't say it's particularly surprising that Sharella Rosado, the CEO of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allure Realty</a> is the wealthiest of the bunch. She's been in the real estate business for a while and launched her company in 2019. Currently, Allure Realty is globally recognized and stands as one of America’s top brokerages. Rosado is presently estimated to have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $6 million, and just like the characters on the sister show, Selling Sunset, the drama with these rich folks never ends.</p><h2 id=rena-frazier---2-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rena Frazier - $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the CEO has a net worth of close to eight figures, it can't be much of a surprise that her number two is closely behind. Of all the agents in Allure Realty, under Rosado’s supervision, Frazier is the most monied. Even though she has been a part of the company since its early days, she had a pretty outstanding career before it. She holds a law degree and practiced for over seven years before Allure, a time within which she was made a partner at the law firm. Joined with the money she made from her previous line of work, Frazier is currently estimated to have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $2 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Name Friendliest 'Selling Sunset' Star, And It's Not Chrishell Stause</a></span></p><h2 id=juawana-colbert---1-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Juawana Colbert - $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the many qualities that have kept Sharelle Rosado at the top of the food chain in her line of work is her ability to spot the best of the best and bring them in. Juawana Colbert is one of the high achievers recruited by Rosado. Before becoming a part of her company, and by extension the show, she worked in finance. According to information on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>, she has held several executive positions in the past, including project manager, Vice President of a development council, and business development manager at different organizations. So far, she has worked at Allure for close to three years and is estimated to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth</a> $1 million.</p><h2 id=tennille-moore---1-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tennille Moore - $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tennille Moore is one of those business-minded women who are actively involved in a variety of fields. While she currently works at Allure Realty, she also holds a certificate proving her a certified credit repair specialist and has her own company in that line of business. Additionally, she also works as a Legislative Assistant at the Florida House of Representatives. All of this, while also closing real estate sales, it's no surprise she has an estimated net <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth </a>pegged at $1 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Selling Sunset': Who Has The Most Instagram Followers In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=karla-giorgio---800-000><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Karla Giorgio - $800,000</span></h2><p>Karla Giorgio's strong point is her professional experience, as she has been in the real estate industry for quite some time now.
