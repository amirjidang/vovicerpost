Les Wexner borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank to open the store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center. Originally named “The Limited,” the store initially focused on clothing for younger women.</p><p>In 1990, Bath & Body Works underwent a repositioning and transformed into a beauty line for Express, Inc. With this change, the company changed its name to Bath & Body Works, paving the way for its expansion and success. Since then, Bath & Body Works has evolved, diversifying its product offerings and becoming the largest specialty retail beauty brand globally.</p><p>Today, Bath & Body Works is known for its extensive range of products, including body lotions, fragrances, soaps, and candles.
