"Maybe he was in love too," she said of Albie.</p><p>"Because sometimes when you're on holiday vacation you just feel your emotions in a heightened way. So, maybe he was in love. When I read the script, I dreamt about Lucia and Albie at the end, maybe in Los Angeles or wherever in the world. But together."</p><p>Speaking to TheWrap, the actress also shared her theory about Lucia's genuine attraction to Albie. "She does say that she has always had this dream of going to the United States [and] going to Los Angeles," she said. "And probably that's another element that she feels attracted to [in] Albie, because he comes from such a different world of hers, which is Taormina."</p><p>Well, we've all had our Lucia or Albie at one point in our youth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60edKipKimkWLBoq7ArJqoZZKas7C%2BxGahqKGenruoedahoK2dXaG8tcHSZqqemaOku25%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./whoopi-goldberg-aretha-franklin-last-wish-604584.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Whoopi Goldberg Shares Aretha Franklin's Last Wish</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-lil-tjay-wife-inside-the-family-of-the-rapper-333333-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Lil Tjay Wife?
