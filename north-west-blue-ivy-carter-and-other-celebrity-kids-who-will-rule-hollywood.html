Ever since Emme debuted her rendition of Alicia Key’s hit song “If I Ain’t Got You,” the internet has been raving about her stellar voice.</p><p>The 11-year-old joined her mom on stage during the It’s My Party tour to perform Jennifer’s 2018 song “Limitless” and also appeared in the song’s music video. Emme also joined her mom on the world's biggest stage during the 2020 Super Bowl.</p><p>The Super Bowl Halftime Show at 11-years-old?

The oldest child of Beyoncé and Jay Z has been breaking records since she was born. In a matter of days since her birth, Blue Ivy became the youngest person ever to appear on a Billboard chart, thanks to her cameo on Jay-Z's fatherhood track, “Glory (feat. B.I.C.),” which was released two days after her arrival. The track features audio of then baby Blue Ivy’s cries and other baby sounds. The song debuted at No. 74 on Billboard’s R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That wasn’t Blue Ivy’s only record. Last Summer at just 7-years-old, Blue Ivy was featured on her mom’s track “Brown Skin Girl” for The Lion King’s soundtrack. Not only does Blue Ivy sing on the song, but the Carter’s first-born was also given a writing credit and a composing credit, making her first appearance into songwriting. Something tells us Blue Ivy will be making more appearances on the Billboard charts in the near future.</p><p><strong>Moroccan & Monroe Cannon</strong></p><p>Moroccan & Monroe Cannon are the children of best-selling female artist Mariah Carey and TV host Nick Cannon. The 8-year-old twins already have experience performing live having opened for their mom’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” Las Vegas residency.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They also made cameo appearances for the 2019 version of their mom’s #1 hit of the same name.

The six-year-old has shared the stage with her father Kanye during several of his Sunday Service gatherings. In a video posted by her mom, North is singing along to the music, which captured her father’s attention. Kanye brought the mic to North’s mouth and she sang along.</p><p>This isn’t the first time North has stolen the show. During another Sunday Services gathering, North passionately sang along to the music while Kanye and the choir grooved in the background. Kanye, a 21-time Grammy winner, looked like a proud parent with a giant grin on his face throughout the clip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye And Jay-Z Are Buddies Again, The Tidal Lawsuit Is In The Past!</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilqKqknXq4sdKtZJukpZp6qsLYZpqaqqSav26tzZ1kqKyYmr9ur8SlnJuqmanGbrfInapmr5ikeri1y6Vkq62cmnqpu8ulsLCnn5l8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pascale-huttons-biography-husband-children-measurements-511027-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pascale Huttons Biography: husband, children, measurements</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./netflixs-you-causes-confusion-for-fox-news-host-laura-ingraham.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Netflixs You Causes Confusion for Fox News Host Laura Ingraham</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
