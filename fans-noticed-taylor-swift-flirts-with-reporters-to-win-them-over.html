After watching the beloved singer chat on red carpets and in video interviews, fans realized something compelling: Taylor Swift tends to flirt with reporters regularly.</p><h2 id=fans-realized-taylor-swift-flirts-with-reporters-during-many-interviews>Fans Realized Taylor Swift Flirts With Reporters During Many Interviews</h2><p><strong>Taylor Swift <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">flirts during so many interviews</a></strong> that a fan put together a compilation video. When appearing on The Graham Norton Show, the singer <strong>complimented Saoirse Ronan for starring in Hanna</strong>, the 2011 action movie. She said, "I literally wanted to fight after I saw you in that movie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-refused-to-stream-her-eras-tour-film-after-she-felt-as-though-the-studio-s-vision-didn-t-align-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg><p>Ronan looked touched and said that she would teach her.

Fans might not expect her to compliment reporters in return, but this is something that she does regularly. When <strong>Extra TV interviewed Swift</strong> and the reporter said she looked great and asked if she would turn around, Swift said "I will try to" and had a flirtatious look in her eyes. When she was asked if she had a date, Swift said "I'm dateless...

Swift repeated "like this" and gestured to the reporter's body.

Swift said:</p><p>"What are you talking about? You are so gorgeous it's hard to talk to you. Don't even do that. You have the cheekbones. I don't have the cheekbones."</p><p>That wasn't the only time that Swift praised a reporter. In an interview with Spin, she didn't comment on the reporter's looks, but was pleased with a phrase that the journalist used. When the reporter called Swift a "single pringle" and the singer was pleased with the term.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/this-is-how-taylor-swift-spends-her-billion-dollar-net-worth-1.jpg><p>Swift asked:</p><p>"Did you invent that? I think you should take credit for that. You're amazing with rhymes. Have you made one up for my name yet or are you working on it still?"</p><p>While some might say that the singer just wants to be warm and friendly when she's being interviewed, some fans might wonder if she's flirting on purpose so the reporters like her more. When Swift was interviewed by The BBC and the reporter thanked her and said "it was dreamy" chatting, Swift said, "you're dreamy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Swift appeared on the red carpet of the 40th American Music Awards and a reporter praised her, Swift said "I love you.

Most of the time, she is asked about her dating life, and she doesn't want to share details. Understandably, she wants to keep certain things to herself, especially since she bares her heart and soul in her music. At the end of 2023, fans couldn't stop talking about the time when <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres interviewed Taylor Swift in 2013</a> and wouldn't stop asking about her "boyfriend" Zac Efron.
