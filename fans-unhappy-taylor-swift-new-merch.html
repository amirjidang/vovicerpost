Whether it is an entire full-length album, a re-recorded album, or just a new single. It seems Swift always has something up her sleeve. She is also extremely meticulous about when she releases content.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So when Swift was hinting at something coming on May 13th, (13 being her favorite number) fans really thought they were getting another re-recorded album, but it was something else.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-released-a-new-re-recorded-track>Taylor Swift Released A New Re-Recorded Track</h2><p>Swift has been up to a lot musically. She has a new song titled Carolina in the upcoming film, Where The Crawdads Sing based on a novel with the same title. <a href=#>This song has only been teased </a>in trailers of the movie but will be released this summer when the film comes out.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Taylor Swift Album Is The Most Successful?</a></span></p><p>So when Swift made a post on Instagram about yet another song of hers being featured in a movie trailer, fans were stoked. They were even more excited when they found out it was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">song of Swift's called This Love that was featured on her 2014 Grammy Award-winning album, 1989.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift posted the trailer for an Amazon television series called The Summer I Turned Pretty also based on a novel with the same title. The series comes out this summer and the trailer features the re-recorded version of Swift's song This Love. Unlike Swift's Carolina song, she released the entire version of This Love on all streaming platforms.</p><p>The cover art for the song was very 1989-esque showing Taylor on a Polaroid picture filter, which is similar to the Wildest Dreams re-recorded cover art and the original 1989 one. The reason this was such a big deal to Taylor Swift fans is that to them, it seemed like this meant that 1989 would be the next album to be re-recorded. <a href=#>Swift fans are always wondering which album will be next.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seemed pretty clear that Swift might just release the entire 1989 (Taylor's Version) the same week she released This Love. So when Swift and her team said there would be an announcement on May 13th, fans were fully expecting to have the new re-recorded album.</p><h2 id=fans-are-disappointed-after-new-taylor-swift-announcement>Fans Are Disappointed After New Taylor Swift Announcement</h2><p>Alongside releasing This Love, Swift also released merch to go alongside the song. This merch included not only 1989 items but also Speak Now, her 2010 album. Releasing this merch was to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrate the announcement of This Love</a> being released. But it still had fans hopeful that it meant either 1989 or Speak Now would be released soon, some fans even thought she would release both re-recordings at the same time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's 10 Most Popular Songs (According To Spotify)</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, fans were not correct and on May 13th (the day fans expected a new 'Taylor's Version' album) Swift and her team instead just released more merch. This time it was a summer themed collection titled the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiftie Summer Collection</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although fans were disappointed about having merch instead of new music, they are of course still on the lookout for any new announcements on either re-recorded singles or full albums! Since fans know how Taylor Swift works, she may just release new 'Taylor's Version' music when they are least expecting it. For now, fans can snag some 1989, Speak Now, and summer Taylor Swift merch while they wait for those announcements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-fans-are-quick-to-forgive-their-favorite-artist>Taylor Swift Fans Are Quick To Forgive Their Favorite Artist</h2><p>Aside from music, Taylor Swift experienced a huge milestone just last week. Not long after <a href=#>The Clive Davis Institute at New York University launched a Taylor Swift course for students to take</a>, she received a degree from them. She attended the New York University 2022 commencement at Yankee Stadium to receive an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts Degree. She posted a TikTok of herself getting ready for the ceremony and putting on her cap and gown.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift To Receive Honorary NYU Degree</a></span></p><p>She gave a wonderfully inspiring speech and received so much praise and love from the crowd. She even added a little humor to her speech saying, <a href=#>"getting canceled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although fans were upset that Swift didn't release any 'Taylor's Version' albums, they were still there to 100% support their favorite artist. Even calling her "Doctor Taylor Swift". A huge accomplishment for Taylor Swift alongside all of her other major successes in her career. For now, fans of Swift can play This Love (Taylor's Version) on repeat until Swift herself announces her next re-recorded album!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Taylor Swift Fans Aren't So Sure About The Latest Films She's Working On</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsKvtMCpp7JlpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapeq%2Bx1maknqqTnXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fifty-shades-of-grey-cast-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fifty Shades of Grey Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./enrique-iglesias-100-million-net-worth-what-does-he-spend-his-money-on.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Enrique Iglesias Has A $100 Million Net Worth: What Does He Spend His Money On?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
