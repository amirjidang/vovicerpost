It all started with <a href=#>Walt Disney</a>'s passion for animation that gave us truly magical films such as&nbsp;Snow White&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bambi. Then, in the 1950's came TV and&nbsp;The Mickey Mouse Club&nbsp;complete with Mouseketeers. But even then, the Disney universe was not the squeaky clean place it appeared to be. Put boy and girl Disney stars with raging hormones and lots of money together and what do you get? Well, s*x, drugs, and a little rock 'n roll, a place where Mouseketeers swap s*x tips, smoke pot, and get up to things no 14-year-old should be doing. Then came social media, the cell phone, selfies, and leaked nudies.&nbsp;Add in the nude shots, lingerie shots, and shots in hotel rooms. Dare we mention s*x tapes? The simple fact is that squeaky clean Disney always has been and always will be a cesspool, a sin bin, and a downright nasty place to be. Here are 15 scandals that prove just that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dylan-sprouse---hey-that-s-my-exposed-junk-on-the-internet><strong>Dylan Sprouse - "Hey, That's My Exposed Junk On The Internet"</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Dylan and Cole Sprouse</a>, also known as the Sprouse Brothers, were the richest twin stars way back in 2008 when they starred&nbsp;in Disney Channel's&nbsp;The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,&nbsp;the often hilarious hotel-living exploits of Zack and Cody Martin. Dylan Sprouse was the naughty one, Zack. And Cole was Cody, the adult leadership of the pair. Fast-forward to 2013 and Dylan and Cole were studying at New York University. And, well, up popped pictures of Dylan. They were totally bizarre naked selfies Dylan snapped in a bathroom mirror. "Hey," Dylan reportedly said when the snaps were leaked online, "that's my exposed junk on the Internet." And, to add insult to injury, it was a tiny junk. Cole joked that it must have been freezing cold in that bathroom. Ouch!</p><h2 id=britney-spears---s-x-drugs-and-alcohol-by-15><strong>Britney Spears - S*x, Drugs, And Alcohol By 15</strong></h2><p>When her father became abusive, young Britney ran to her aunt's trailer to seek refuge. Well, it was Mississippi. Momager Lynne dragged a very young <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> off to auditions, lying about her age in hopes of getting her on The Mickey Mouse Club. She finally succeeded and Britney was propelled into the cesspool that was Mickey Mouse and his "club." Then, in 2007, Britney landed in rehab and had what can only be described as a head-shaving, baseball bat-whacking meltdown. "Nut case," they said. So what does momager Lynne do? The next year, she writes a book saying Brit started drinking at 13, lost her virginity at 14, and started doing drugs at 15. And these days? Brit's under a possibly permanent conservatorship overseen by none other than her alcoholic, abusive dad. If you had that lot as a family, you'd be nuts too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=orlando-brown---oral-stuff-battery-a-dirty-tape-and-dui><strong>Orlando Brown - Oral Stuff, Battery, A Dirty Tape, And DUI</strong></h2><p>Back when Orlando Brown and <a href=#>Raven-Symone</a> were young teenagers who starred in&nbsp;That's So Raven together, rumor has it that they got "together." The guy even went on TV and demonstrated what he did with his tongue. Don't ask. Then, there is the DUI and a spot of meth possession. And, oh yeah! He got done for battery on his girlfriend. Was it the same girlfriend he made a s*x tape with? The one that he released online?&nbsp;WTF! And did we mention the death threat he made? The guy has clearly gone off the rails big time. Or maybe, like <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, he believes the only bad publicity is no publicity. He's trying to crack into rapping with songs about...well...sucking things, you know. That takes us back to Raven.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez---meltdowns-depression-addictions-and-rehab><strong>Selena Gomez - Meltdowns, Depression, Addictions, And Rehab</strong></h2><p>What do you get when you mix a poor Texas background and divorced parents with a talented and beautiful little girl and an ambitious and pushy momager? Well, you get one messed-up young woman by the name of <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>. By the time she was in elementary school, mom was dragging her off to auditions. And, momager hit the jackpot in 2007 when Selena was signed to star in Disney Channel's Wizards of Waverly Place.&nbsp;As soon as she was 18 and "emancipated," Selena sacked mom. By then, she had famously dated and broken up with <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>. Rumors of Selena's depression, alcohol abuse, and worse were hard to shake. There were times when she appeared in public with sacks and the like over her head. Hiding in plain sight or dangerously erratic behavior? Stints in rehab and fall-outs with the likes of <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> have added to the picture of a troubled, out-of-control young woman. Many fear there is worse to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus---underage-s-x-drugs-and-swinging-both-ways><strong>Miley Cyrus - Underage S*x, Drugs, And Swinging Both Ways</strong></h2><p>Where do we begin? Well, by the time she was 13 or 14 years old, she was the huge star of Disney's mega-hit&nbsp;Hannah Montana. Inside Disney, Miley Cyrus was smoking pot and talking (and some say doing) s*x. Heck, she was dating a 20-year-old guy when she was 15. Her father,&nbsp;<a href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, has gone on record saying that when Disney came into their lives, he lost Miley to a world of raging hormones, Disney minders, and adult pleasures. She smoked pot with <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a>, had older lovers, and outed herself as bis*xual at the tender age of 14. And these days? She's "freeing the nipple," snapping selfies with s*x toys, and causing outrage with nude photoshoots and the like. Miley's motto? The only bad publicity is no publicity. Possibly.</p><h2 id=vanessa-hudgens---leaked-nudies-times-three><strong>Vanessa Hudgens - Leaked Nudies Times Three</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens</a> was Disney's singing and dancing girl next door in 2006's&nbsp;High School Musical.&nbsp;For a time, she was "supposedly" all loved up with Zac Efron. She was the darling of the Disney universe. Then, in 2007,&nbsp;at the height of her High School Musical&nbsp;fame, came&nbsp;those pictures. Pictures? Vanessa was snapped by "someone" in lingerie. Vanessa was naked, in the buff, nude, au naturale. Disney went into meltdown panic and Vanessa and Disney executives were barricaded in the Disney Studios, trying to figure out what to do. At the end of the day, she apologized and said 'never again'. Then, in 2009? Same song, second verse. More leaked nudes. And in 2011? One more time. She doesn't even bother to comment anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan---dui-drugs-jail-and-rehab><strong>Lindsay Lohan - DUI, Drugs, Jail, And Rehab</strong></h2><p>It's been around twenty years since a cute kid called <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> appeared as troublesome twins in Disney's remake of&nbsp;The Parent Trap.&nbsp;Then,&nbsp;in 2003, she was a cute teenager alongside <a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;Freaky Friday.&nbsp;But, even then, the young Lindsay was known for her hard-partying wicked ways. Starting in 2007, she entered a cycle of DUI charges, court dates, 'orange is the new black' jail time, followed by stints in rehab. Then, she seemed to be thumbing her nose at the law when she started not showing up on court dates. Shots of Lindsay passed out in cars or going into or coming out of rehab became the norm. Stories of her running around naked in a London department store made the rounds a couple of years back. Her career? What career? And, she looks like hell. 30 going on 50.</p><h2 id=demi-lovato---assault-self-harm-girl-on-girl-and-rehab><strong>Demi Lovato - Assault, Self-Harm, Girl On Girl, And Rehab</strong></h2><p>Rumor had it that Demi Lovato and Miley Cyrus were getting s*x tips as giggling pot smokers backstage at the Disney studios. They were&nbsp;both perhaps 14&nbsp;at the time. Demi hit it big in 2008's&nbsp;Camp Rock&nbsp;alongside heartthrobs, the <a href=#>Jonas Brothers</a>. Speaking of "hit," an out-of-control (probably drunk) Demi socked a backup dancer while on the set of&nbsp;Camp Rock in 2010. Oops! Disney said. 18-year-old Demi was sent to rehab under the cover story that she was "sick." Sick? What about the addictions, the eating disorder, and a tendency to harm herself? Sick is not the word for the mess she was. Then came all those "cozy" girl-on-girl rumors and photos. These days? She's supposedly cleaned up her act. And with all that, it's hard to believe she's only 24.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zac-efron---dating-boys-cocaine-alcohol-and-rehab><strong>Zac Efron - Dating Boys, Cocaine, Alcohol, And Rehab</strong></h2><p>After knocking around the odd TV show, 18-year-old <a href=#>Zac Efron</a> hit it big in 2006 as the singing basketball player in Disney's High School Musical. He had been a pretty boy model with a habit of taking his clothes off for photo shoots. So, there was talk. And a few years ago, rumor had it that he was dating his Neighbors co-star, <a href=#>Dave Franco</a>. But in 2013, Zac really hit the spotlight (for all the wrong reasons) when he was "outed" as a cocaine addict. He landed in rehab amid talk of out-of-control and dangerous behavior. Has he cleaned up his act? Some point to his fall at home that resulted in a broken jaw and the fight with a Skid Row homeless man, as evidence that something is still up with the troubled 29-year-old. The fact that Baywatch has been a spectacular flop won't do much for his ego.</p><h2 id=adrienne-bailon---hot-shots-in-hotel-room><strong>Adrienne Bailon - Hot&nbsp;Shots In Hotel Room</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a> likes girls with big butts and lots of tattoos. Maybe that's why he hooked up with the likes of <a href=#>Blac Chyna</a> and <a href=#>Adrienne Bailon</a>. If we could show you the rest of this picture, you would see Bailon with her big butt naked, sporting a tattoo you could just about read. Google it if you don't believe us. In 2008, Disney's&nbsp;Cheetah Girls&nbsp;star suffered the leak of some embarrassing pictures, obviously taken by someone else in a hotel room full of champagne glasses, lingerie, and naked backsides. Some said that the pictures were taken by her then boyfriend, Israel Houghton. Who knows? Well, this was at about the same time as the first of three Vanessa Hudgens' leaked images. Adrienne claimed her laptop had been stolen, while some say that she leaked the pictures herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brenda-song---fabricated-pregnancy><strong>Brenda Song - Fabricated Pregnancy</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Brenda Song</a> had a sweet gig as the stuck-up heiress London Tipton in&nbsp;The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. London&nbsp;was stuck-up funny and totally stupid. And Brenda was dubbed "the Queen of Disney" and praised for being a non-party scene good role model for young girls. But, fast-forward to 2011. She was dating <a href=#>Trace Cyrus</a>, who just happens to be Miley's (we think ugly) brother. Well, seems like the Queen and good role model lied to Trace and his entire family, telling them she was pregnant with his child. There was even some talk of a miscarriage. Why on earth would she fabricate such a story, though? To trap him, probably. It all came out in 2015 in a heated social media exchange between a pissed off Trace and an oh-so-sorry Brenda. "Yes, they were lies THAT U MADE UP," he&nbsp;fumed.</p><h2 id=lee-thompson-young---suicide><strong>Lee Thompson Young - Suicide</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Lee Thompson Young</a> was the skateboard-riding, cell-phone-to-his-ear star of Disney's The Famous Jett Jackson.&nbsp;He was young and cheeky and full of himself.&nbsp;Jett was street-cool, fun, and always had a smile on his face. But, in real life, Lee Thompson Young fought the demons of depression and self-doubt. He was constantly taking medication to combat his illness. Some say the fame, the pressures of Hollywood, and Disney did him in. In 2013, when he didn't show up for fittings for his show&nbsp;Rizzoli and Isles,&nbsp;police went to check on him and they found him dead in his Los Angeles apartment. He had shot himself in the head. He was 29&nbsp;years old then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hilary-duff---underage-intimacy-and-eating-disorder><strong>Hilary Duff - Underage Intimacy&nbsp;And Eating Disorder&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Hilary Duff</a> was 14 years old when Disney's Lizzie McGuire&nbsp;made her a star and took over her life. She both loved it and loathed it. A couple of years later, she was 16 and still not legal when she was "dating" the Good Charlotte lead singer <a href=#>Joel Madden</a>. And, we all know what that means. He was ten years older, so they kept their relationship a secret until she was 18 and finally "legal." She has also owned up to the fact that the pressures of skinny-obsessed Hollywood led her into an eating disorder which made her rail-thin skinny when she was a teenager. And if all that weren't enough, her ex-hubs and ice hockey ace <a href=#>Mike Comrie</a> was investigated for r*ping a women in his home in early 2017. He says she said yes. Well, truth be told, she said not.</p><h2 id=tommy-kirk---busted-for-pot-and-outed-as-gay-in-the-1960-s><strong>Tommy Kirk - Busted For Pot And Outed As Gay In The 1960's</strong></h2><p>Back in the 1950's, The Mickey Mouse Club hit the televisions and made stars of the likes of <a href=#>Annette Funicello</a> and Tim Considine. And don't forget Tommy Kirk. Who? Tommy was a Mouseketeer who starred in Disney classics such as Spin and Marty and Old Yeller. But as Tommy grew up, his good looks and talent were not enough to save him from the homophobic powers that were at the Disney Studios. You see, there was a problem. He was well and truly gay. And that was a big NO NO as far as Walt Disney and his squeaky clean studio were concerned. Back then, they tightly controlled the image of their stars and a gay was just a nay. Then, it got worse when Tommy was busted for smoking pot at a party. Bye bye Disney. Bye bye career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=walt-disney---s-xist-racist-bigot-and-dictator><strong>Walt Disney - S*xist/Racist Bigot And Dictator</strong></h2><p>Disney was Walt Disney's baby from its very beginnings in the 1920's. He built his empire from literally nothing. But what about those nasty rumors of s*xism and racism? Was Walt Disney just a product of his times or was he an outright s*xist and racist bigot? Some say he was a big time bigot. Look at Song of the South, Disney's retelling of the Uncle Remus stories, complete with an Uncle Tom black star and a somewhat cheerful take on slavery. Take the cold shoulder he engineered for the likes of Tommy Kirk. And what about those rumors of being antisemitic? The guy invited <a href=#>Hitler</a>'s documentary filmmaker to tour his studio and all. Many say he was a dictatorial tyrant who had a vision (or a delusion?) of an America full of white picket fences and small town neighborliness. He ruthlessly imposed it on those around him...or else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2osKK6w5qjrGWkna61ec%2Brpq%2BdXZm2tLrEsmSiq12jvLV50qhkrKmlmq6sxYyco56ZnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-sitcoms-of-the-2000s-no-one-likes-anymore.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Sitcoms Of The 2000s No One Likes Anymore</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-mind-boggling-and-jaw-dropping-billionaire-toys.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Mind-Boggling and Jaw-Dropping Billionaire Toys</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
