Aside from the title, it was actually a brilliant show with a cult following. The series starred Courteney Cox, Busy Philipps, Christa Miller, and others and was co-created by Bill Lawrence, who has now won two Emmy Awards for his show, Ted Lasso.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Jennifer Aniston Close To Courteney Cox's Daughter Coco?</a></span></p><p>Thanks to Cox's connections, several of her Friends co-stars appeared on Cougar Town over the years. Philipps had one of her Dawson's Creek co-stars appear, as well. Oh, and Lawrence's friends from his other series, Scrubs, also made appearances in the cul-de-sac. Fans of all of these shows might want to check out Cougar Town if they haven't already just for the stellar cameos and guest appearances. Let's take a look at the celebrities who made appearances on the series.</p><h2 id=michelle-williams-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Michelle Williams Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In what came as a surprise to many viewers, Oscar winner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Williams made a brief appearance</a> in the tag of an episode of Cougar Town, playing her best friend Busy Philipps' foster sister. The actress is known for her roles in drama, so it was a sight for sore eyes to see her do some comedy. She even quoted Philipps' character's signature "what-what!" in the scene. Amazing!</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Matthew Perry Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><p>Matthew Perry guest-starred on Cougar Town as a love interest for Courteney's character, Jules. His appearance came just months after Courteney made an appearance on his sitcom, Go On. Perry was the third Friends guest to appear on the series, as well as the last one to appear on the show. David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc sadly never appeared on Cougar Town.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lisa Kudrow Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><p>Lisa Kudrow was the first Friends actor to guest-star on Cougar Town. She appeared in the first season as the doctor who gave Courteney's character, Jules, Botox. She ended up dating Cox's ex-husband, Bobby Cobb, while on the episode, and kind of butted heads with Jules during her stint on the show.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston appeared in the season two premiere of Cougar Town, playing Courteney's character's therapist. Lawrence, the show's co-creator, told EW that Aniston's role was a "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">get-too-involved-in-her-life-type of therapist.</a>" Cougar Town wasn't the first time Cox and Aniston reunited on-screen. They first reunited on Cox's FX dramedy series Dirt.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Some Fans Thing Cougar Town Is A Scrubs Spin Off</a></span></p><h2 id=zach-braff-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Zach Braff Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><p>Zach Braff made a cameo appearance at the very end of an episode, in the tag, with other cast members from Scrubs, including Sam Lloyd, Ken Jenkins, who played Jules' dad, and Robert Maschio. Sarah Chalke happened to be guest-starring in the episode, as well. Braff played a pizza delivery guy who surprised Sam Lloyd's character, as he was currently surrounded by people from his old job. Ha!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ali-wentworth-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ali Wentworth Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><p>Ali Wentworth is friends with series star Christa Miller, and thus it's no surprise she made an appearance on Cougar Town. She played a woman who briefly dated the gang's creepy neighbor, Tom, played by Bob Clendenin. She turned out to be a gold digger, just as the gang suspected.</p><h2 id=sam-lloyd-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sam Lloyd Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sam Lloyd, who sadly passed away from cancer, appeared on three episodes of Cougar Town, at one point playing the ukulele in an episode shot in Hawaii. Lloyd obviously knew co-creator Lawrence, as they worked together on Scrubs. Lloyd actually reprised his role as Ted Buckland for Cougar Town, as he played the same character he played on Scrubs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What The Cast Of Cougar Town Is Up To Now</a></span></p><h2 id=nick-zano-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nick Zano Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><p>Back when Cougar Town first began, the show was about a woman in her 40s who was freshly divorced and into dating younger men. Nick Zano was cast as one of the younger men that Courteney Cox's character, Jules, dated. Zano appeared on several episodes before Jules ended up dumping him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-foley-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Scott Foley Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><p>Scott Foley has been a longtime friend of series co-creator Bill Lawrence, appearing on multiple episodes of Scrubs. Lawrence enjoys working with him so much, he gave him a multi-episode arc on the first season of Cougar Town. His character ended up dating Courteney Cox's character, Jules, for several episodes. Funnily enough, Cox and Foley had previously worked together nine years before Cougar Town in a movie fans may have heard of, called Scream 3.</p><h2 id=cindy-crawford-appeared-on-cougar-town><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cindy Crawford Appeared On Cougar Town</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cindy Crawford, whose daughter is good friends with Lawrence and Miller's daughter, Charlotte, made an appearance during the final season of Cougar Town. Crawford ended up playing herself as a surprise. Cougar Town star Josh Hopkins told reporters at the time that the show has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"earned" the right to be outrageous</a>. "The people that stuck with the show know the jokes that are on top of jokes that are on top of other jokes. We've kind of earned our wacky universe." Thus that is how Cindy Crawford randomly made an appearance as herself on the series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6qMHErKtmq6SWv7Oxw2amp2WTpMKordFmq6ivnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stars-who-showed-up-on-monk-before-becoming-famous.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Stars Who Showed Up On Monk Before Becoming Famous</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./whos-next-to-die-15-celebrities-that-arent-looking-too-good.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who's Next To Die? 15 Celebs That Aren't Looking Too Good</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
