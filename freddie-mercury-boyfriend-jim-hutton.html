Hutton worked as a hairdresser in his native County, Carlow, before relocating to London, where he first met Mercury.</p><p>Hutton worked with the charismatic musician for seven years before Mercury passed away suddenly in 1991 as a result of AIDS.</p><p>Hutton passed away from lung cancer on January 1st, 2010, just three days before his 61st birthday, at the age of 60. Hutton received an AIDS diagnosis in 1990 and battled the disease up until his death.</p><p>It took Hutton a year to inform Mercury that he, too, had been diagnosed with AIDS, according to Hutton, who provided care for Mercury during the singer’s battle with the same condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people thought Hutton had died from complications with AIDS, but it was later discovered that lung cancer was the cause of his demise.</p><p>Mercury and Me, a memoir about Hutton’s friendship with the well-known singer, was published in 1994.&nbsp;Hutton included information about his <a href=#>relationship</a> with Mercury in the book and some never-before-seen candid images of the two of them.</p><p>Hutton spoke about the book’s inspiration and how it helped him cope with his sadness following Mercury’s loss in an interview that was conducted soon after the book’s publication.</p><p>Mercury left Hutton a legacy in his will. According to All Things Interesting, Mercury left his partner £500,000 (approximately $1 million today).&nbsp;</p><p>Hutton continued to enjoy a long life before succumbing to cancer in 2010.</p><p>At the time of his demise, he had just turned 61 years old.</p><p>The first day of December is designated as World AIDS Day. It is observed around the world to promote unity in the fight against HIV, to show support for individuals who are infected, and to honor those who have died from the disease.&nbsp;</p><p>Freddie Mercury and other prominent figures who battled HIV/AIDS were honored on this momentous day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did the couple meet?</h2><p>Hutton and Mercury led a very quiet existence away from the cameras. He first met Mercury in a gay bar in the 1980s. Hutton declined Mercury’s offer to buy him a drink since he didn’t know who Mercury was.</p><p>Hutton didn’t accept Mercury’s invitation to a drink until the two finally ran into one other at a pub more than a year later. Soon after, Hutton moved in with Mercury, and the two had a seven-year relationship that came to an end with Mercury’s death in 1991.</p><p>They were essentially a married couple despite never getting married, as gay marriage was against the law at the time. According to The Vintage News, they both wore wedding rings to signify their commitment to one another, and Freddie referred to Jim as his husband.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCy0Z6bnaGVYrqmvsKuqbJlkqTGp77InqWdZZqeum601K2rqKZf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grant-gustins-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Grant Gustins Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./flo-milli-profile-ho-why-is-you-here-beef-flomix-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Flo Milli Summer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
