The entertainer’s first entry into the industry was at the age of six as a child violinist, a skill she acquired after she fell head over heels in love with the musical instrument that brought her a measure of success.</p><p>The diva ruled the screens in her prime and was featured as Miss November 1958 on Playboy magazine. She also made it as one of the twelve distinguished actresses of Hollywood Deb Stars for 1962. Joan passed on in 2019 at the age of 79, but the impact she left in the entertainment industry will always always be with us.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=before-venturing-into-acting-she-made-name-as-a-violinist></span><strong>Before Venturing Into Acting, She Made Name As A Violinist</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Joan Staley was just three, she went with her mother to a concert where she first watched how the violin was played and fell in love with the instrument. This necessitated the acquisition of her own violin by her mother, who also got her an instructor to teach her how to play.</p><p>After a few years, the young lady soon became proficient and it was therefore not surprising when she won an audition to join Peter Meremblum’s Junior Symphony, consequently earning her first film appearance in Emperor Waltz in 1948. After the young talent finished with her college education, she worked as a teletype operator at the William R. Stats brokerage firm before she ventured into films and television work.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=joan-staley-started-with-stage-performances-after-a-long-hiatus-from-acting></span><strong>Joan Staley Started With Stage Performances After A Long Hiatus From Acting</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After making that debut appearance as a child actor in 1948, Joan was not seen again for a long time; however, she resurfaced on the entertainment scene by joining The Little Theater in Hollywood, subsequently appearing in stage plays such as The Robe, Brigadoon, and My Sister Eileen.</p><p>Starting her rise in the world of showbiz, Joan Staley’s hot body and beautiful personality earned her Playboy magazine’s Miss November 1958. She also was among the twelve actresses chosen in 1962 as the Hollywood Deb Star.</p><p>With these appearances, the actress’s name began to gain popularity and she landed a role in the television series Perry Mason the same year, subsequently featuring in several episodes of the highly-acclaimed series. This led her to briefly appear in an episode of the 1959 TV series Laramie.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=she-began-making-regular-on-screen-appearances-from-1959></span><strong>She Began Making Regular On-screen Appearances From 1959</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Before the end of 1959, Joan played Hannah in the television series 77 Sunset Strip, and until 1964, she made appearances in nine more episodes.

After recording a few uncredited roles, she starred in the western Gun Fight, sharing the screen with Hollywood greats like James Brown and Gregg Palmer. Joan had a supporting role in the Oscar-winning cult movie Breakfast At Tiffany’s, with stars like Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard, and Patricia Neal in the lead.</p><p>During her early days in acting, Joan Staley appeared in quite a few number of Hollywood’s most-watched films from the 1960s era, they include the likes of Ocean’s 11 and Midnight Lace in 1960, Jerry Lewis’ The Ladies Man that was released in 1961, as well as the 1962 drama thriller movie Cape Fear.

She appeared on the comedy series in 32 episodes as Roberta and till the end of her acting career that spanned over a decade, the Minnesota native never recorded a greater success.</p><p>The one that came a bit close was her role in the 1966 movie Gunpoint.

By 1966, Joan made an appearance in the leading female role in the family comedy movie The Ghost and Mr. Chicken with Don Knotts. She also showed up in The New Phil Silvers Show and The Lively Ones in 1960.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-horse-riding-accident-forced-her-to-curtail-her-appearances></span><strong>A Horse Riding Accident Forced Her To Curtail Her Appearances</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Joan Staley was forced to cut down on her acting roles after suffering a back injury which was incurred in a horse-riding accident.
