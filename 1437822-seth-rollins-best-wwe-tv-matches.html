The Visionary has been putting on classics for as long as he’s been on the main roster. His performance in 2023 earned him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PWI</a>‘s Pro Wrestler of the Year Award.</p><p>His ability to bring out the best in his opponent has rightfully cemented as one of the best wrestlers of his generation. The World Heavyweight Champion never fails to deliver Match of the Year contender week in and out.</p><p>It’s hard to list down every Seth Rollins great WWE TV match because there are so many of them. I’ve narrowed down the list to five best matches of the Architect on WWE television followed by some honorable mentions.</p><p>On a side note, the list doesn’t include tag team matches Rollins has been part of over the years. I think that deserves a separate list of its own, given his incredibly history with The Shield. So without further ado, let’s jump right into it:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-seth-rollins-vs-austin-theory-wwe-raw-october-31-2022>Seth Rollins vs. Austin Theory (WWE RAW – October 31, 2022)</h2><p>Seth Rollins and Austin Theory had an excellent singles match in the lead-up to Survivor Series: WarGames 2022. The pair had 15 minutes to tell their story and they fired on all cylinders.</p><p>Theory entered the match as the cocky heel against the more experienced Rollins. Booking the youngster against the veteran was a brilliant more on Triple H’s part. The blockbuster sequence was smooth.</p><p>The fast-paced action had some great back and forth spots. Theory got a little too cocky while going for a Pedigree. This proved to be his undoing as Rollins countered with a vicious Curb Stomp for the win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Seth Rollins vs. Neville (WWE World Heavyweight Title Match – August 3, 2015)</h2><p>Seth Rollins first world title reign featured some excellent matches on WWE TV. The Architect put his title on the line in an open challenge. The opportunity was answered by none other than NXT standout Neville.</p><p>The former NXT Champion collided with the future Monday Night Messiah in an extremely fast-paced match. Both men displayed some great chain wrestling in the early goings until Rollins got hold of the pace.</p><p>The match featured one of the greatest near falls on RAW. Rollins narrowly avoided a humiliating defeat by kicking out of the Red Arrow in the nick of time. He’d defeat his opponent with a Pedigree.</p><p>Neville was extremely underutilized in his stint on the main roster. This match proved he could be a consistent performer week in and out, but Vince McMahon wasn’t just into the cruiserweight style of wrestling.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Seth Rollins vs. Finn Balor (WWE RAW – April 2, 2018)</h2><p>Seth Rollins and Finn Balor collided in singles competition days before WrestleMania 34. This match started off slow with some technical wrestling. Both men worked on each other’s arms to gain momentum.</p><p>Both men went over 20 minutes, which itself was a shock to see in 2018. They made great use of the time with in-ring work. The crowd was into the action from the get-go. Rollins claimed the win with a Curb Stomp.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Seth Rollins vs. Edge (WWE SmackDown – September 10, 2021)</h2><p>Edge’s second WWE run gave fans many dream matches. The Rated R Superstar had a great feud against Seth Rollins in 2021. The two men kicked off the action with a blockbuster match at SummerSlam 2021.</p><p>Their next, and often overlooked match came on Friday Night SmackDown in September. The two bitter rivals delivered a PPV quality match on free TV for fans to enjoy. Their were some brutal superkicks and traces of technical wrestling.</p><p>Both men would have one of the best matches in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE Crown Jewel</a> history two months later.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose (Falls Count Anywhere Match – August 18, 2014)</h2><p>Seth Rollins’ betrayal of The Shield was one of the most shocking moments on WWE television in 2014. The Architect made enemies of his brethren by aligning himself with The Authority. His betrayal put him on a collision course with Dean Ambrose (aka Jon Moxley).</p><p>Both men spent the second half of 2014 in a tense feud. Ambrose wanted Rollins in singles competition and he got his wish on the August 18, 2014, episode of RAW. They met in a Falls Count Anywhere Match.</p><p>This was an all-out brawl featuring some brutal spots. Ambrose took some nasty bumps in this match. The Lunatic Fringe landed head-first on a pile of chairs – courtesy of a running powerbomb by Rollins. The Curb Stomp on a pile of concrete blocks forced to referee to rule the match in the Architect’s favor.</p><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><ul><li>Vs.
