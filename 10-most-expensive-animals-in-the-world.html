If you are wondering what these creatures are and how expensive they are, take a look at this list of the top 10 most expensive animals in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-toucan---5-000-to-10-000><b>10. Toucan - $5,000 to $10,000</b></h2><p>The name Toucan has been derived from the Portuguese term ‘Tupi tucana’. This majestic bird is found in different locations, including Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Southern Mexico. They are extremely popular for their large and very colorful bills. The family currently has forty different species.</p><p>While the legs of the Toucan are short, they are very strong and sturdy. Their toes come in pairs, with the first and the fourth being turned in a backward position. The feathers of these magnificent creatures are often black with yellow, crimson, and white patches. These beauties are being sold for a minimum of $5,000, but the price can go up to $10,000.</p><h2 id=9-de-brazza-s-monkey-7-000-to-10-000><b>9. De Brazza’s Monkey – $7,000 to $10,000</b></h2><p>De Brazza’s Monkeys, also commonly referred to as swamp monkeys, are found in the wetlands of Central Africa. These creatures got their name from the French explorer, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. They are very hard to locate because of their superior and innate hiding abilities. They have a life span of about 22 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-hyacinth-macaw--14-000><b>8. Hyacinth Macaw- $14,000</b></h2><p>Priced at an average of $14,000, the Hyacinth Macaw is not only the biggest macaw species, but it is also the world’s largest flying parrot. It stands tallest of all the other species of parrots known to man. This parrot is native to the eastern and central regions of South America. However, because of their extreme popularity as home pets, their population in the wild has taken a heavy blow.</p><p>The Hyacinth Macaw has an extremely powerful beak that is uses to eat foods like seeds and other hard nuts. The beak of these birds is so strong that they can even crack the hard shell of a coconut. Aside from these, the parrots also eat vegetables as well as fruits. For pet owners, they often feed their parrots with pine nuts.</p><h2 id=7-palm-cockatoo---16-000><b>7. Palm Cockatoo - $16,000</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The palm cockatoo is known for its black or smoky grey color and the visible red spot on its head. This parrot is the sole member of the bird’s monotypic species known as Probosciger and associate family. It stands 55 to 60 cm (22 to 24 inches) tall and weighs around 910 to 1,200 grams. It was originally described by Gmelin, a German natural scientist way back in 1788. This unique bird, featuring a large crest, is also one of the parrot species that have very large bills. The average price of a Palm Cockatoo is $16,000.</p><h2 id=6-stag-beetle---89-000><b>6. Stag Beetle - $89,000</b></h2><p>The stag beetle is quite the strange species, which makes it even more expensive. It is characterized for its red and blood-like curling mandibles and antlers protruding from its black head. This particular beetle is a member of the Lucanidae family that currently has 1,200 insect species. The average-sized stag beetle measures around 2 to 3 inches in length. However, the one that was brought to a retailer had a length of more than 3 inches. The Japanese breeder was able to sell his beetle for a whopping price of $89,000. He got his money on the spot for this weird, but rare creature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-white-lion-cubs---138-000><b>5. White Lion Cubs - $138,000</b></h2><p>The white lion clubs come from an extremely rare lion breed. White lions can be found, but only rarely, in the South African wildlife reserve. They are not considered to be a separate subspecies yet, so it was declared that they are home-grown to South Africa’s Timbavati region. The Global White Lion Protection Trust has reported that there are now only around 300 living white lions world-wide.</p><h2 id=4-sir-lancelot-encore---155-000><b>4. Sir Lancelot Encore - $155,000</b></h2><p>Sir Lancelot Encore is a result of a dog-cloning procedure. Edgar and Nina Otto, the Florida couple who owned the world-famous Lancelot, decided to clone his DNA after losing him in 2008 because of cancer. The result is Sir Lancelot Encore, who made them the winners of the Bio-arts auction that took place in San Francisco.</p><h2 id=3-tibetan-mastiff---582-000><b>3. Tibetan Mastiff - $582,000</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Tibetan Mastiff is one of the most costly dogs that you can take home as a pet. The average price of this particular breed runs to about $582,000. In addition to being very expensive, it is also one of the largest dog breeds worldwide. The largest of their breed has been reported to stand more than 32 inches tall, with a weight of over 150 lbs. These dogs come in varying colors, including black, brown, red and gray. Pure white Tibetan Mastiffs have also been reported, but they are extremely rare.</p><p>Unlike many other breeds, these extremely expensive dogs are known for not having the same unpleasant odor that many dog owners encounter. In fact, they have long since been respected as guardians of farm animals. They are extremely protective, with some having killed tigers before to safeguard their flock.</p><h2 id=2-miss-missy---1-200-000><b>2. Miss Missy - $1,200,000</b></h2><p>Miss Missy is a white Holstein Cow now aged three years old. Back in 2009, she won the Western Fall National Show North America’s Grand Champion title. This is actually one of the most renowned animal shows worldwide. Since she ended up as a champion, a lot of people rushed to buy her. Her owner paid $1,200,000 to get her home. With this being said, it should no longer come as a surprise to you that she holds the world record for being the most expensive cow to have ever been sold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-green-monkey---16-000-000><b>1. Green Monkey - $16,000,000</b></h2><p>If you thought that this is the world’s most expensive monkey, think again. The Green Monkey is actually a horse. This race horse was purchased by Demi O’Byrne at the Calder Race Course while it was still a 2-year old. With its descendants being Kentucky Derby champions, it only made sense that the auction winner had high hopes for the horse. Unfortunately, a race has never been won by this multi-million dollar animal. It retired officially on the 12th of February, 2008. Being worth $16,000,000, there is no denying the fact that Green Monkey gets the top rank in this list of the 10 most expensive animals known today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZKano6l6psTPnqWsoaaaeqK6yKaYpatdnrtuwMeeZLCnoqGxcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-of-the-most-expensive-tropical-fish.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 of the Most Expensive Tropical Fish</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-celebs-who-guest-starred-on-nickelodeon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Celebs Who Guest Starred On Nickelodeon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
