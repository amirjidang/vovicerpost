A lot of people think about their perfect bodies, hairstyles, and flawless public appearance, and to be honest can you blame us for these thoughts? Hollywood and the mainstream media are constantly perpetuating an image of what perfection is that makes a lot of people feel insecure or unworthy of happiness. But when the cameras aren't rolling, the lights off, and everybody goes home, even some of your favorite celebs suffer from the same issues that we as average citizens face. For instance, one in thirty-three children are born with a physical deformity, think about it... that's a lot. And we're not saying that us normal people are walking around dragging a single leg, with an enlarged eyeball hanging out of our eye sockets, but how many of those children do you think grew up to pursue entertainment and have successful careers? A lot more than you would think. Take a look at some of Hollywood's most prosperous and beautiful celebrities that just so happen to have some rather strange body parts/deformities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=karolina-kurkova>15. Karolina Kurkova</h2><p><a href=#>Karolina Kurkova</a> is hot, she's a high fashion Czechoslovakian model, and is well known as one of Victoria's Secret Angels. What possibly could be wrong with such a beautiful specimen? It's less of what's wrong with Karolina Kurkova and more like what's missing from&nbsp; Karolina... Most of us, can look Karolina up and down and not notice a single thing wrong with the A-list model, but if you look closer, you'll notice she's missing the most crucial scar to human existence... her belly button. No she's not an alien or some genetically grown, beautiful clone, but according to one of her representatives Karolina had an operation as an infant that resulted in her scar-less abdomen. Doctors claim that this could be because of an umbilical hernia, that is a semi-common occurrence during the early stages of a child's life. Regardless, her Barbie like mid-section hasn't stopped her from being one of the most sought-after models of today. Let's just hope the rest of her body parts aren't so 'Barbie-like'... that'd be a waste.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=mila-kunis>14. Mila Kunis</h2><p><a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> may play the voice of Meg on Family Guy, but she sure doesn't look anything like the Meg we all know in the hit TV show. Anyways, a lot of us recognize her from the popular sitcom&nbsp;That's 70's Show&nbsp;and a multitude of other TV and movie appearances, but what a lot of people don't know about the Hollywood starlet is that she suffers from a rare deformity and that just so happens to be the entrance of her very soul. Mila was born with a condition known as heterochromia&nbsp;iridum. The condition happens when the eye suffers from a lack or excessive amount of pigmentation in the pupil that causes two different eye colors. It sounds cool, but in Mila's case the condition caused her to go partially blind, and she had to have a cataract surgically removed. Here's what Mila had to say about her vision to Cosmopolitan back in 2011: "I was blind in one eye for many years, and nobody knew… I'm not blind anymore. I had surgery a couple of months ago. They cut it open and dropped a new lens in there." Who would have known that one of Hollywood's biggest stars was a half-blind hot chalacha. Regardless, we'd stare in those in eyes anytime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kesha>13. Kesha</h2><p><a href=#>Kesha</a> has definitely raised some eyebrows in the past, whether it's her unkempt, grungy look, or the fact that she publicly admitted to drinking her urine, she doesn't hold back. Some time ago, the spontaneous pop star was spending time over the pond and had&nbsp; revealed one of the strangest personal secrets we've heard a celebrity spill in recent years. This what she randomly told British magazine and publication, Heat, "I had a tail when I was born. It was a tiny tail, about a quarter of an inch. Then they chopped it off and stole my tail." Seriously, one of pop's hottest songwriters used to have a tail... Let that soak in for a minute. As of late, Kesha has been out of the limelight due to some rather heinous accusations that have pinned her against her record label and production team. We're hoping everything turns out well for the starlet, we miss her dirtiness and spontaneity on and off screen. With or without her tail, Kesha's a hottie, but definitely one that would require the proper contraception. After all her fans are called 'animals,' we think we know why now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=megan-fox>12. Megan Fox</h2><p><a href=#>Megan Fox</a> is the equivalent to what hot is... She's also definitely one of Hollywood's most beautiful and talented starlets. From head to toe she's virtually flawless, except for one little thing, Megan suffers from a birth defect known as brachydactyly, or more commonly known as 'clubbed thumbs.' If you're anything like us, we know you're thinking 'psshhh clubbed thumbs? I'd club a baby seal to get next to her...' Ok, we might have taken that a little far, but Megan is actually a little self conscious about her condition and while on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, she had this to say about her stubby thumbs; "What is weird to me is I was talking to my mom … and she was like, 'Oh, I ate tuna every day when I was pregnant with you,' I was wondering if that was what happened to my thumbs. They're weird and they're really fat and there's like a weird knuckle." Honestly, all Megan needs to know is that her strangely shaped, short thumbs hasn't stopped guys around the world from imagining about holding one of those so-called 'disfigured' hands of hers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=gemma-arterton>11. Gemma Arterton</h2><p>This gorgeous face belongs to none other than <a href=#>Gemma Arterton</a>, and most of you guys should recognize the English actress from the 2008 James Bond: Quantum of Solace, and the more recent Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time film. Gemma hasn't had the most lengthy Hollywood career compared to&nbsp;some of the others on this list, but boy is she well deserving to be here. Can you imagine going in for a slow peck on Gemma's hand only to count out six fingers, and quickly look to her other hand only to count out six more fingers?! Well, fortunately for you this nightmare will never come true but it is a fact that at one point the English actress did have twelve fingers. Gemma was born with a condition known as polydactyly, it's a rare deformation that allows&nbsp;fetuses to grow extra fingers while in the womb. Unfortunately, we will never have the chance to marvel at the beautiful actress' extra appendages because as a baby she had them removed by tying them, cutting off the circulation, and watching the fingers simply fall off. Call us weird if you want, but the thought of Gemma Arterton's extra fingers kinda turns us on...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=ashton-kutcher>10. Ashton Kutcher</h2><p><a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a> has always been a weird and quirky kinda dude. From his goofy That 70's Show days to his Punk'd days to his much more serious reenactment of Steve Jobs, in 2013's biopic Jobs, Ashton has grown up before our very eyes but we still get that cheesy kid brother vibe from the guy and the fact that he has a condition known as syndactyly, but we know the condition as webbed fingers or webbed toes. Ashton's second and third toes on his right foot are completely webbed. Ashton's been known to show off the webbed appendages and for some strange reason, those little suckers have gained so much popularity on their own, they might just go on their own media tour in the near future. Honestly, it looks like the guy stepped in fresh gum; we understand he's not one to shy away from his flaws, but we'd like it if Ashton kept his feet off any tables and kept his socks on. Also, notice how his significant other, Mila Kunis, made this list? With those genes mixing together, we wonder if their daughter has any strange conditions. Hm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=joaquin-phoenix>9. Joaquin Phoenix</h2><p>Many of us love <a href=#>Joaquin</a> for his convincing acting skills, but do you guys know the actor is a film producer and music artist too? Not only has he been nominated for several Academy Awards, he's also a winner of a Golden Globe, and even has a Grammy of his own. From what it looks like it appears that Joaquin was born with a microform cleft lip, that in most cases takes corrective cleft palate surgery to fix. But according to the actor, he was born with the scar and refuses the idea that he has cleft lip that only brings up further questions on our behalf. Usually, people with cleft lips have problems with their speech and senses, let's just say Joaquin was lucky enough to escape those struggles. Clef lip or not, it hasn't stopped him from having a prosperous career or his luck with the ladies on that part. The guy was amazing in Gladiator by the way...</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=denzel-washington>8. Denzel Washington</h2><p><a href=#>Denzel</a>'s one of the smoothest and most charismatic actors of our generation and his resume proves so. From his performance in Malcolm X, to one of our favorite antagonists in Training Day, to his performance in the true story Flight, his diverse acting chops have got him to the A-list status he so ever deserves. One thing though, as a kid during a friendly game of basketball, he broke his pinky on his right hand but never sought out the proper medical treatment to have it set back in place. In result of not doing so, his pinky now sticks out at a forty-five degree angle while holding the rest of his fingers straight... In some ways we're disgusted, but with a&nbsp;smile like that and the ability to take about anyone's girlfriend if he tried, we'll continue to big up the blockbuster actor.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andy-garcia>7. Andy Garcia</h2><p>If you need anyone wacked or to do your dirty work in Hollywood, we would definitely recommend who we would like to think of as our very own bad ass uncle, <a href=#>Andy Garica</a>. From his performance in The Godfather III to his work in the Ocean's Eleven series, Andy is definitely the epitome of smooth. One thing that's not so smooth about the actor, and what probably makes him the strangest on this list is that he was born with a conjoined twin attached to his shoulder. Yeah, sort of like the nurse in South Park who has her conjoined twin attached to her cheek but not as gross. Andy had his softball-sized sibling removed from his shoulder at a very young age and has no recollection of even having a twin. All Andy has left to commemorate his late sibling is the scar that rests atop of his shoulder.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-taylor>6. Elizabeth Taylor</h2><p><a href=#>Elizabeth Taylor</a>&nbsp;is the only one on the list who is no longer with us, but she is forever immortalized as one of the greatest British-American actresses and influencers of all time. Also, if it wasn't for Andy Garcia's conjoined twin shoulder, Elizabeth would have taken the title for having the strangest body part/physical deformity. Liz Taylor was born with an extremely rare genetic disease called lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome. It's a hereditary disease that can cause physical ailments. Elizabeth's most notable physical ailment was that she was born with two sets of eyelashes. Alright, we understand how most of you ladies wouldn't think having an extra layer of eyelashes would be a bad thing, but what if we told you that her condition potentially caused the hairs to grow inward and damage her cornea? Doesn't sound so appealing now does it? Throughout Elizabeth Taylor's illustrious career, she struggled with many health issues and at one point had congenital heart disease. Even with all of these ailments, Liz remained as beautiful and influential as ever and for that, she will never be forgotten.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daryl-hannah>5. Daryl Hannah</h2><p>Ok, so at first glance some of you youngsters may not know about the greatness that is <a href=#>Daryl Hannah</a>, but in the 80s you couldn't keep her off the silver screen, from the blockbuster movie Blade Runner to Steel Magnolias Daryl Hannah was one of Hollywood's elite. Don't get us wrong, Daryl has done some work you might know of by <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino's</a> Kill Bill series, in which she played a one-eyed assassin, but in reality instead of missing an eye she's actually missing part of an index finger. While speaking with South Africa's Sunday Times, Daryl revealed that she got her finger stuck in the pulley of her grandmother's well and was forced to have it amputated. Ugh. She also claimed that shooting during films she might use a&nbsp;prosthetic but claims she doesn't really need it... and we agree! We hope to see her and all eleven and a half of her fingers on the screen in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gerard-butler>4. Gerard Butler</h2><p>This might be the funniest entry on the list due to the unknowing victim <a href=#>Gerard Butler</a>. Then again with this guy's acting chops, we're pretty sure he's not stressing about the fact that he found out about his strange physical deformity a little over a decade ago back in 2003; doesn't bother him. Especially since he'd been living with it for nearly his entire lifetime. As a child, Gerard suffered from a bad case of tinnitus that almost resulted in him losing his ability to hear. Doctors were forced to perform a surgical procedure in order to save his hearing but unfortunately the procedure left him with asymmetrical ears. While prepping for the movie Tomb Raider, Gerard was forced to shave his head for the role, and discovered how much his left ear stuck out. During production, he was forced to glue the ear back just so it wouldn't be so much of a distraction.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-garner>3. Jennifer Garner</h2><p>Unfortunately, <a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a>'s film debut was in 2001's Dude Where's My Car?&nbsp;Fortunately for her, it didn't stop her Hollywood career from blossoming into the greatness that it is today. For the most part, Jennifer is one of the hottest brunettes on screen, she's got the hot jaw line we know it's weird to say but seriously look at it, mesmerizing eyes, and perfect figure. What more could you want out of an A-list starlet? Unfortunately, the powers that be forgot to equally distribute some of her gorgeousness into her feet, because these bad boys look rough... Jennifer suffers from a semi-common disease known as&nbsp;brachymetatarsia. It's a condition where one of the bones in the foot, most of the time the pinky toe, is shorter than the rest of the bones in the foot causing the toe to overlap it's neighboring toe. Jennifer's feet may look funny, but it wouldn't stop us from delivering one of the greatest foot massages of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=seal>2. Seal</h2><p>If you haven't scream-sung 'Kiss From A Rose' during your regular commute to or from work you haven't lived, and luckily we have <a href=#>Seal </a>to thank for writing a piece of musical literature that will go down as one of the best songs of a generation. Seal's been a pillar in the music industry since the early 90s and somehow has remained relevant to this very day. To those that know about the condition scientifically known as discoid lupus erythematosus, or lupus for short know that the disease can destroy you from the inside out to the point that your skin is visibly and permanently scarred. This is the exact case for Seal's cheeks and nose bridge. It's an awkward conversation piece and he's probably used to and tired of explaining his condition but we're sure he's not mad... After all the guy did bag <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> and even though things went sour in their relationship, lupus still isn't stopping him from dating model and singer Erica Parker. If you're battling lupus or know someone who is, continue to stay strong and supportive, it's what Seal would want!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=harry-styles>1. Harry Styles</h2><p>This one's for all of the teeny boppers out there. You're One Direction boy band member, <a href=#>Harry Styles</a>, is a freak... and not in a good way you little pervs. You know how most people are born with two hands, two eyes, two ears, two nipples, two of everything right? Harry Styles has a condition known as supernumerary nipples and was born with a total of four. That's right kiddies your man crush Monday has a body reminiscent to that of a cow, complete with four udders. He's very open about his extra nipples and had this to say to Star magazine about his strange condition, "I've got four nipples, I must have been a twin, but the other one went away and left it's nipples behind." Even though the guy's got extra nipples we definitely wouldn't want him around our girlfriends, with or without his shirt on.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>radaronline.com</a>, <a href=#>perezhilton.com</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqbV2Ysq2xwaxksKCfYsawwYydoJ2mpGK4r7vWZp%2BanF2owbOtzaCcZpqfmcZuvMCrq6xn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
