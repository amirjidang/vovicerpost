While Howard certainly has a reputation of having quite the mean streak, it appears as if his ex-staff have had a lot to say, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming he is worse than Ellen DeGeneres</a>. Despite his crass ways, Stern has also managed to form a number of close relationships with a number of massive names in Hollywood, including Jennifer Aniston and Jimmy Kimmel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Old Is Dolly Parton? (And 9 Things You Didn't Know About Her)</a></span></p><p>Although he has gotten on a select few people's good sides, it seems as if Howard has rubbed a lot of folks the wrong way! The star has often been compared to a number of comedians including Joan Rivers, and Chelsea Handler, due to his tell-it-like-it-is attitude, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stand-up was never in the cards for Howard</a>. While he may have a successful career, Howard has burned a number of bridges getting there. Here are 5 celebs who adore Howard, and 5 who stay away!</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston---love><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston - Love</span></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston and Howard Stern share quite a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> long and close relationship!</a> The duo met through their mutual friend, Jimmy Kimmel at Aniston's former hubby, Justin Theroux', and when you are friends with Jimmy Kimmel, you are bound to become friends with Howard Stern, which is exactly what happened with Aniston. The group, who all hang out together,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> even go on vacation with their spouses,</a> proving just how close a crew they all are!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow---love><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Gwyneth Paltrow - Love</span></h2><p>Gwyneth Paltrow is practically Hollywood royalty, so it is only fitting for her to be close to Stern, who has been deemed as the "King of all media". The two may not be the closest of friends outside of their professional relationship but certainly share a special bond.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Why Howard Stern Thinks John Lennon Would've Hated Him</a></span></p><p>Paltrow has appeared on The Howard Stern a number of times, with her most recent interview being a big one. During her last time on the show, Gwyneth dropped a number of bombs surrounding Harvey Weinstein's status in the industry and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how Brad Pitt essentially protected her </a>from the wrath of Weinstein.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-tyler---love><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Steven Tyler - Love</span></h2><p>Howard Stern and Steven Tyler go way back! The rock and roll legend has been close to Stern for most of his career, making their bond quite a special one. The two met in the industry and through Howard's successful radio show at the time. Steven Tyler has paid Howard a visit to his show a number of times and is one of the few hosts that he opens up to regarding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his past drug and alcohol use</a>. Tyler and the rest of Aerosmith have even performed for Howard on his show in a special performance back in January of last year.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel---love><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jimmy Kimmel - Love</span></h2><p>When it comes to Howard Stern's friendships, he's got a plethora of talk show hosts in his inner circle, Jimmy Kimmel being one of them! The two have been friends for quite some time, appearing on one another's shows. In 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern re-proposed to his wife</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beth Stern</a>, on Jimmy Kimmel Live! a surprise that not even Jimmy knew about. The two are known for mostly having a very "laid back" friendship, and considering both of their personalities, we don't doubt that for a second.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katherine-heigl---love><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Katherine Heigl - Love</span></h2><p>While Howard Stern can be quite crass at times, it appears as if he always has a little bit of love left in his heart when it comes to a few Hollywood celebs. Katherine Heigl and Stern share a special relationship considering he is one of the few people to continuously have Heigl on his show, despite the actress being "blacklisted" from the industry. Katherine has received so much scrutiny within Hollywood that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had to seek therapy,</a> a journey she shared with Stern on her most recent visit to his radio show.</p><h2 id=kathie-lee-gifford---stays-away><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kathie-Lee Gifford - Stays Away</span></h2><p>Kathie-Lee Gifford, much like Howard Stern, began her career out in the media the same time Stern did. While there has been no concrete situation leading to their feud, which believe it or not, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lasted a whopping 30 years,</a> the two have since let things go.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Real Reason Howard Stern Didn't Change His Name</a></span></p><p>During the brunt of it all, Kathie revealed that she took the high road while Howard hurled insults at her for decades on his radio show. Luckily for the two, things have not only been settled, but Howard went as far as sending Kathie-Lee flowers on her last day alongside Hoda Kotb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bon-jovi---stays-away><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bon Jovi - Stays Away</span></h2><p>Although you would expect Howard Stern and a rock group like Bon Jovi to be quite tight-knit, however, it seems as if it is the complete opposite! Stern has notoriously spoken out regarding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his disdain for Bon Jovi</a>. The "Living On A Prayer" group appeared on Howard Stern's show prior to gaining immense success, however, after they blew up on the charts, they didn't seem at all interested in giving Howard a visit with their newfound fame. This obviously didn't sit well with Howard, who believed that they gained arrogance along with their success.</p><h2 id=dolly-parton---stays-away><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dolly Parton - Stays Away</span></h2><p>It appears as if the Queen of Country herself, Dolly Parton, is NOT a fan of Howard Stern. The radio host found himself on Dolly's bad side come a few years back when he took snippets of her audiobook and spliced them together in order to make it seems as if she was saying very crude and racist remarks, which is obviously not the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Howard has admitted his actions were stupid, the 'Jolene' singer was having none of that! Dolly went as far as commenting on Stern's actions, saying she was utterly "shocked and humiliated" says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste Of Country</a>.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian---stays-away><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kim Kardashian - Stays Away</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>2 </span><span></span></h2><p>Howard Stern and Kim Kardashian are two people who you will never see together! After Kim Kardashian's Paris robbery back in 2016, Howard Stern took to his radio show to discuss the details surrounding the case, claiming that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian may have even lied </a>about the heist for publicity! Kim "should go to jail", Howard insisted on his show if the star was, in fact, lying about the robbery. The event was later covered on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, where Kim could not believe Howard would make such a statement!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=madonna---stays-away><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Madonna - Stays Away</span></h2><p>You would have to be the most courageous person to even be able to say you are feuding with an icon as big as Madonna. Well, Howard Stern cannot care less! The radio show host has had quite a lot to say about the pop icon, much of which has to do with her vocal abilities, or lack thereof, said Stern. Despite being one of the biggest entertainers of our times, Howard finds himself puzzled as to how the singer became so famous. The star did not think she could sing all that great, which is not something Madonna loves to hear.&nbsp;They buried the hatchet back in 2015 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna made her debut appearance</a> on 'The Howard Stern Show'.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Why Amy Schumer Credits Howard Stern For Her Career</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZKWnppp6qbvWmqmdZaOpsrO6jJqlnWWnnbxuv9OasGaZp5bGbrLRqKRmoJmifA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./8-ways-in-which-seth-macfarlane-earns-his-300-million-fortune.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>8 Ways In Which Seth MacFarlane Earns His $300 Million Fortune</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-bella-twins.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Things You Didn't Know About The Bella Twins</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
