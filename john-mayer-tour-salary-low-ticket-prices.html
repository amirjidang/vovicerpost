John Mayer's 2023 tour is all about him up there on the stage, playing his guitar and connecting with his massive fanbase. <a href=#>Mayer has a high net worth</a> and it's easy to guess that much of his income comes from traveling around the world and performing in venues ranging from huge stadiums to more intimate spots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mayer also seemed to have enjoyed himself during several spring 2023 stops. In Seattle in April, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">concertgoer had a sign</a> that said "Surprise Song Request" and suggested that the singer choose A, B or C. According to Uproxx.com, Mayer said it was "clever" and agreed to sing his tune "Love Is A Verb." John Mayer's 2023 Solo Tour includes opening acts Alec Benjamin and Lizzy McAlpine and has been popular from the start. Did touring in 2023 make the singer a wild amount of money?</p><h2 id=what-do-john-mayer-39-s-2023-tour-tickets-cost>What Do John Mayer's 2023 Tour Tickets Cost?</h2><p>Fans couldn't wait to buy tickets for John Mayer's 2023 tour. But unlike <a href=#>Taylor's Swift pricey Eras tour tickets</a>, fans didn't have to shell out a ton to see Mayer perform. This was likely a relief as it seems like these days, seeing a favorite musician or band can mean spending a small fortune and wishing that it was more affordable. Or, as so often happens, fans are unable to get tickets at all and that can feel more than a little upsetting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tickets for John Mayer's 2023 concerts range from $75 to under $200 (before tax). The singer is playing at the Sound On Sound festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut on October 1st, 2023. Fans can spend $179 on a one-day pass to the festival. Since this is where John Mayer was born, this must also be a special show for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/john-mayer.jpg><p>Mayer is performing at Madison Square Garden in October 2023. And while this is a famous venue and it might seem like tickets would be hundreds of dollars or even close to a thousand, fans can purchase tickets for $175.50, according to Ticketmaster.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans attending his concert at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville on October 11th, 2023 only have to pay $75 per ticket.

It started in March 2023 with performances in Atlanta, St. Louis, Chicago, and St. Paul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/john-mayer-1.jpg><p>When it was clear that a lot of people wanted to see him perform, he made sure that he was going to visit cities like Tampa, Dallas, Philadelphia, and New York City in the fall of 2023. Other cities include Los Angeles, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Charlotte, and Austin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-did-john-mayer-make-from-his-2023-tour>How Much Money Did John Mayer Make From His 2023 Tour?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Mayer's 2023 tour has been super profitable</a>, according to Billboard.

According to Good Morning America, he said that he was definitely going to continue playing live music, but he wanted to get into the studio as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/john-mayer-performing.jpg><p>The singer wrote, "I love touring and will continue to play live shows, but in staying open to whatâ€™s driving me creatively, it felt like making more music was the most inspired feeling I had. I know the Sob Rock tour was only in the US, and though I will make it to other cities and countries in the future, Iâ€™ve just got more songs to make."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>John Mayer has eight albums, from his 2001 debut "Room For Squares" to his 2021 release "Sob Rock." Although he posted on social media that he wanted to record songs rather than tour, it seems like he really wanted to get on the road and play his songs acoustically. And since he did really well financially from the tour, this was a wise business decision.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has John Mayer Been Dating Someone Under The Radar?</a></span></p><p>In April 2023, Mayer shared on Instagram that he was thrilled with the response from his fans during his tour. It sounds like the tour has also been a great and fulfilling creative experience for the singer.</p><p>He wrote on Instagram, "When I had the idea to embark on a solo tour, I was thinking about the technical aspect of it; how to pull off a show where it was just me up there. What I didnâ€™t - and couldnâ€™t - factor in was how the audience would add a kind of magic Iâ€™d never experienced before."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/john-mayer-avoiding-the-paparazzi.jpg><p>Mayer continued that whether he does more acoustic performances in the future or not, he wants to remember how he felt during these shows. He wrote, "Thank you for showing me the next steps in my life and in my careerâ€¦ a tour! A tour did this. Thank you, I love you, and I hope I see you again soon."</p><p>John Mayer's 2023 tour seems to be so popular that the singer kept planning more dates.
