She currently plays the lead role in CBS' Blood & Treasure, Lexi. Her mother is from Morocco while her father is from Spain. Their family moved to the US when she was five years old. She grew up in a multilingual household in Orange Country, California, making her fluent in English, Spanish, German, and Arabic. Pernas originally wanted to be a journalist but ended up doing modeling, then acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from The Brave and Blood & Treasure, Pernas also starred in The Young and the Restless from 2015 to 2017 and Jane the Virgin from 2016 to 2017. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a 2019 interview with Brief Take</a>, Pernas said that playing strong female roles like her Blood & Treasure character, Lexi has helped her become a better version of herself. "I think, and any actress who plays a strong female character would agree, it makes you stronger playing those characters," she said. "Because my whole path, my journey of realizing who I am and staying tethered, and obviously having a big family, because I come from a big family and a conservative background, it's been hard."</p><p>She added that making it in Hollywood was challenging at first. "The journey as a young woman, finding acting and all of that stuff, it's been a tough path," she continued. "But when you get to play women who have their wits about them and are grounded and indomitable and have that kind of moxie, it's emboldening. It's definitely empowering, and in this strange way, when you put on Lexi's jacket or the pants, as soon as the costume comes together, you can kind of see it in your mind's eye. I know who this woman is and it helps me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Milo Ventimiglia Want 'This Is Us' To End?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-justin-hartley-amp-sofia-pernas-meet>How Did Justin Hartley & Sofia Pernas Meet?</h2><p>The two used to work for nearly a year in Young and the Restless back in 2015. The nephew of Hartley's character, Adam Newman was the boyfriend of Pernas' character, Marisa Sierras. At the time, the actor was still dating Stause — who also appeared on the show for 10 episodes after Pernas left. In 2021, Hartley said that he "liked being around" The Brave actress even when they were just co-stars. "You meet in different capacities. We didn't work together that closely, and we didn't work together that long," he shared. "I knew that she was very kind and very nice. I liked being around her. But I was in a different place in my life. I wasn't available."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he said that he doesn't regret dating her much later. "Timing has a lot to do with that," he explained. "I'm very lucky to not only have found 'the one,' but I found her when she was available and the timing was right." In May 2020, Us Weekly confirmed that they were dating. They tied the knot in March 2021. "We got married in March, and we are so happy!" the actor gushed. "It's incredible when you're not forcing things. It doesn't have to be that hard. You just meet the right person and you just go, 'Oh, this is amazing. It's just so wonderful!' You're so attracted and so attached to this person. You just love this person so much."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Stars of 'This Is Us': Where They Got Their Start</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-justin-hartley-amp-sofia-pernas-39-marriage-like>What's Justin Hartley & Sofia Pernas' Marriage Like?</h2><p>Months after their wedding, Hartley said that he couldn't recall what it was like living without Pernas. "Even though we've only been married a few months, it's hard to remember what it was like without her," he said. "When I re-met her, I just knew. It's so interesting about the human heart and human mind. It's not a codependency; I'm just at peace with myself. I feel loved and I feel appreciated. I know she feels the same way. We just have a really great relationship and a really terrific family. It's healthy and it's wonderful."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 2022, Pernas said that they're still in their honeymoon stage. "Obviously, we're still in the honeymoon phase. We're wearing matching outfits," she joked to Entertainment Tonight during the Critics' Choice Awards before correcting herself. "No, this is our forever phase," she quipped. A month later, she shared that she gets along well with <a href=#>her stepdaughter, Isabella Hartley</a>. "She's so wise. I mean, that girl, she's got it figured out! She knows exactly what she wants," she said. "She has a beautiful, wonderful boyfriend. I don't want to say too much about it because she's like, 'Ahh!' but they're awesome."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How 'This Is Us' Saved Mandy Moore's Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsButtSsq6KmXZ2us8DLnrCsZaees6Z50qidopldpbKzusCsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kimberly-schlapman-learn-about-the-singer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Kimberly Schlapman?
