As their sight-unseen love story was unfolding, it was revealed that <a href=#>Lydia dated Uche months prior</a> to the show. The bombshell news ultimately <a href=#>proved to be too dramatic</a> for Uche’s pod love interest <strong>Aaliyah Cosby</strong>, who opted to walk away before proposal day. Milton, for his part, stayed the course and remained focused on his romance with Lydia.</p><p class=p1>“I think [what] it really just comes down to is <a href=#>our values were the same</a>,” Milton explained to <i>Us</i> of their relationship. “We had the same morals, we wanted the same things out of life. From day one, it just kind of felt like a hit, just felt like a match. So, we just wanted to really pursue that and see where it could take us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/milton-johnson-reacts-to-claims-lydia-went-on-love-is-blind-for-uche.jpg><p class=p1>Milton and Lydia — who have <a href=#>a nearly 7-year age gap</a> — took their relationship to the next level in Friday’s new episodes. After they finally met in person, they were <a href=#>quick to explore physical intimacy</a> on their post-engagement getaway to Mexico.</p><p class=p1>As their relationship deepened when they met one another’s families and friends, things got real when Uche and Lydia<a href=#> nearly came to blows</a> during a pod squad party. Uche had slammed Lydia about her reality TV intentions, which he initially heard from Aaliyah. Lydia, for her part, denied that she went on the show for Uche.</p><p class=p1>“I really didn’t have the conversation with them,” Milton told <i>Us </i>of witnessing Lydia and Uche’s fight. “But I went on the show for one reason: to potentially find my future wife. So that’s my first objective.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/milton-johnson-reacts-to-claims-lydia-went-on-love-is-blind-for-uche-inline.jpg><p class=p1>He continued: “Lydia had all the traits that I would prefer my wife to have, so I pursued her. It’s just an additional benefit that I got to eat great food and <a href=#>made a great group of friends</a> like <strong>Chris [Fox]</strong> and the rest of the cast members. But, at the end of the day, [finding love was] the primary objective I came for and I wanted to execute on that. So that takes priority over everything else.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>Love Is Blind </i>season 5 is currently streaming on Netflix.
