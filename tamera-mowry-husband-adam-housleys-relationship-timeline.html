We said to God, ‘This is who we are, I know you take us as we are, our faults, our fears, our joys, our hope as a couple and have your way.’”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">After realizing that they had each found The One, the twosome got engaged in January 2011 and tied the knot four months later. In November 2012, Us Weekly confirmed that the couple had <a href=#>welcomed their first child together</a>, son Aven John Tanner. Daughter Ariah was born in December 2020.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“We are so blessed and excited right now,” Housley tweeted at the time, noting that the <a href=#>newborn resembled her older brother</a>. “Ariah Talea Housley was born at 2:54. … We are so excited to have Ariah here. Such a strong girl!”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">In September 2018, the couple made headlines after fans began to criticize Housley for <a href=#>his past work at Fox News as a senior correspondent</a>. However, Mowry stood strong beside her man.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“There are some people who think that my husband is racist because he worked for a certain channel,” she said during an episode of her talk show, The Real. “I’m gonna look in that camera right there and let everybody know my husband is not a racist.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The former Disney Channel actress’ defense wasn’t the first time she had spoken out in support of her husband’s views. The Seventeen Again star, who identifies as biracial, opened up about the racist criticism she’s received herself since marrying Housley.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“It’s hurtful because <a href=#>my husband and I are so openly and fine with showing love</a>, but people choose to look past love and spew hate,” she said in a 2014 interview.&nbsp;“That’s what hurts me because I’ve never experienced so much hate ever in my life.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Scroll down to relive Mowry and Housley’s romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaK5xKuYZqWfrL%2B6eceuqpuZnpl6orDApmShp6WouabF0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5xo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-cast-of-seinfeld-where-are-they-now-in-pictures.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Cast Of Seinfeld: Where Are They Now?
