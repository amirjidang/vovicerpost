After a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">scandalous divorce from journalist Maria Shriver</a> in 2011–during which it became apparent that Schwarzenegger had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a love child with another woman</a>—the actor’s romantic future seemed unclear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, however, the “Terminator” star has clearly moved on, and once again, it&nbsp;is clear that Schwarzenegger is not too concerned about what others may say about his relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold Schwarzenegger At 72: This Is How He Eats And Trains</a></span></p><h2 id=age-is-just-a-number>Age Is Just A Number</h2><p>The former governor’s current flame for physical therapist Heather Milligan was outed in 2013, when the two were spotted kissing in Santa Monica,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;reports. Milligan was thirty-eight years-old when the couple first became public; Schwarzenegger, in contrast, was sixty-six.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some folks would potentially let a twenty-eight year age gap get in the way of love, Schwarzenegger and Milligan have not let the decades get between them. Seven years after they were spotted stealing that first kiss, the pair continues to seem happy and in high spirits.</p><p>During their time together, the two have traveled to exotic destinations, including Austria and Barcelona. They also continue to enjoy the simper things in life—paparazzi have even noticed the couple biking around their neighborhood to get some fresh air during quarantine.</p><p>The couple’s romantic relationship has left some fans wondering, who exactly is Heather Milligan? And what is it about her that is so attractive to the former governor? We have done some digging to clue readers into what’s really going on between the actor and the physical therapist.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Photos Show How Much Arnold Schwarzenegger Has Changed Over The Years</a></span></p><h2 id=milligan-the-total-tom-boy>Milligan, The Total Tom Boy</h2><p>One of the major points of connection between Schwarzenegger and Milligan is their shared interest in the world of sports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Milligan’s Twitter account</a>, the physical therapist has her own practice called Elite Ortho Sport, where she treats professional athletes for their sports injuries. If the practice’s Instagram account is anything to go by, some of the athletes who pass on through are a really big deal.</p><p>On March 6, 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elite Ortho Sport</a> posted a photo of professional baseball player Rigo Fernandez coming out of treatment. “Good luck...as you continue rehab with the @whitesox,” reads the caption.</p><p>Although Milligan clearly has her own thing going on at her work, she is not afraid to use her expertise to combine forces with her boyfriend. She has even participated in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schwarzenegger’s famous strength competition</a>, the Arnold Strongman Classic, by treating some of the participants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January of 2019, the physical therapist was tagged in a photo in which she is featured putting her skills to work on an athlete who was injured at her boo’s event.</p><p>If that doesn’t show a strong point of connection, we don’t know what does!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Baena: These Pics Show He’s Like His Father, Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=arnold-in-the-white-house>Arnold In The White House?</h2><p>An interest in sports does not seem to be the only thing bringing the couple together. Milligan has also demonstrated an interest in politics—or, more specifically, Schwarzenegger’s political career.</p><p>While the physical therapist’s social media is almost exclusively focused on her own professional development, she has also posted in favor of Schwarzenegger’s political rise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On February 2, 2017, Milligan retweeted a post that reads, “retweet if you prefer Arnold Schwarzenegger over Donald Trump as president of the United States. I’m in!”</p><p>Despite the fact that Schwarzenegger’s foreign birth prevents him from assuming the role of President, it seems that his girlfriend is willing to support his political aspirations until the very end.</p><p>Whether or not this means that Schwarzenegger continues to express an interest in his political pursuits also remains unclear, but we will certainly keep an eye on Milligan’s Instagram account to see if the pair plans to clue&nbsp;us into any future endeavors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Love Child Joseph May Be His Favorite. Here’s Why</a></span></p><h2 id=what-s-next-for-the-lovebirds>What’s Next For The Lovebirds?</h2><p>Neither Schwarzenegger nor Milligan has recently made&nbsp;any kind of public statement concerning the future of their relationship. However, a quick glance at their Instagram accounts shows that the two just seem to be enjoying their love.</p><p>At the beginning of August both partners posted the same video of their dog and pet donkey snuggling on the couch. The clip shows a very specific kind of domestic bliss, featuring both a “Schwarzenegger” inscribed throw and a pillow with the California state flag sewn onto it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the background, fans can see an extraordinary view of rolling green hills. Perhaps the “Terminator” and his partner have finally found a sort of romantic peace.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perez Hilton Reveals: Katherine Schwarzenegger & Chris Pratt Tried To Keep Their Baby A Secret</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6afobFuv8Khrpqqqpq7prPGnqlmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWVjbXq6scCrqmannJl6qbHArZ%2Beql2itq24yKCYp2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-jagger-eatons-parents-everything-to-know-about-the-athletes-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are Jagger Eatons Parents?
