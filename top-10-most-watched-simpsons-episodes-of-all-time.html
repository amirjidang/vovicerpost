Over those many years, millions and millions of people have sat in front of their televisions to see what Springfield’s favorite family is up to. There are certain episodes however, that have been seen by more people than others when they were first aired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of these top ten most-watched episodes come from the show’s first season in 1990 when there weren’t as many viewing options out there. The last few years has seen the show’s audience decline steadily to a point where barely three or four million people are tuning in on a Sunday night for a new episode. Every single episode on this list had at least 27 million people watching. It could be a matter of viewing tendencies in this day and age with cable forcing its way into the habits of consumers but the golden days of network television have gone by the wayside.</p><p>Who knows how much longer the Simpson family will be entertaining us with various pranks on Moe or the occasional Flanders appearance, but it is still one of the most beloved shows on television today. Here are the top ten most watched episodes of The Simpsons.</p><h2 id=10-season-1-episode-3-homer-s-odyssey><strong>10.

Luckily, Lisa finds the note and alerts the family who hurries over. The family nearly gets run over by a truck and Homer saves them, giving him new reason to live. He would get his job back at the plant when Mr. Burns offers him a new position as safety inspector with a higher salary. It is definitely an episode that shows that life is worth living no matter how bad things get.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-season-1-episode-7-the-call-of-the-simpsons><strong>9.
