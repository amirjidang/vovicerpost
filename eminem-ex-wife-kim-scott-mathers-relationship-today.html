Now that the rapper is 50 years old, it's amazing to reflect on his life and career. It's impossible to talk about the rapper without remembering his difficult relationship with his ex-wife Kim Scott Mathers. The couple has been married twice, and before they broke up for good, they went through years of pain. Even after their divorce, they appeared to struggle with their feelings toward each other, which is understandable.</p><p>Now that many years have passed since Kim Scott Mathers and Eminem split up, fans want to know more about their current situation. Here's whether Kim Scott Mathers and Eminem have a more positive relationship today than they have had in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-eminem-and-kim-scott-mathers-get-along-now>Do Eminem And Kim Scott Mathers Get Along Now?</h2><p>For many years, Eminem's fans heard negative story after negative story about his relationship with Kim Scott Mathers. There was a period of time when they seemed to have so many problems that it would have felt impossible to say that one day, they would actually get along.</p><p>But there doesn't seem to be any evidence that they are still fighting or that they currently have a hard time with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Does-Kim-Mathers-Still-Talk-About-Her-Ex-Eminem.jpg><p>Eminem and Kim also share a daughter who was born in 1995. <a href=#>Hailie Jade Scott Mathers talked about her childhood</a> on her podcast A Little Too Shady and talked about the awesome opportunities she had because of her dad. Since Eminem has always made it clear that he really cares about his daughter, this was sweet to hear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans can guess that the former pair still talks to each other sometimes if something comes up with their daughter Hailie. But since Hailie is now 27 years old, she is living an independent life away from her parents. Her mom and dad don't need to talk about custody arrangements or any related topics.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eminem Might Have Done Wrong By His Ex-Wife Kim Scott And Their Kids In This One Way</a></span></p><p>However, Eminem and Hailie seem to be much tighter than Hailie and her mom are. According to Page Six, Hailie's fiance Evan McClintock said on the Little Too Shady podcast that Hailie hosts that he talked to Eminem about making sure that he was okay with McClintock proposing. He didn't mention asking Mathers for permission.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hailie-jade-scott-mathers.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The publication also reported that Hailie and McClintock celebrated their engagement with a gathering in May 2023. Eminem and Kim Scott Mathers didn't seem to be there, at least not from what people could see on social media.</p><p>Fans can only speculate here, as it's impossible to know if Hailie invited her parents. But since she has always had a good relationship with Eminem, it seems likely that she wanted him to be there and he just wasn't able to make it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eminem Showed No Hesitation Walking Off The Stage During His Concert After Fans Misinterpreted One Of His Gestures</a></span></p><p>In 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Scott Mathers talked about Eminem</a> on 20/20 and said that she didn't have any negative feelings toward the rapper at that time in her life. She said, "I am not trying to bash Marshall or make him look bad, [I] just, you know, want people to know, I am a person, too.

Also in 2007, Kim spoke on the Detroit radio station WKQI-FM and said that she really didn't like thinking about Eminem.

While he hasn't shared his current feelings toward his ex-wife, he did decide that he would be alright with having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joint custody of Hailie Jade Scott Mathers</a> back in 2000.</p><p>According to Abcnews.go.com, Hailie began living with her mom when she was young, but Eminem was still able to see her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/does-kim-scott-mathers-get-along-with-the-kids-she-had-with-eminem_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Eminem hasn't said much about his ex-wife in recent years, he has shared a little about his dating life. This is definitely something that people have wanted to hear more about.</p><p>In a 2017 interview with Vulture, the rapper said that he had a profile on Tinder. He also said that it was difficult to go on dates and explained, "It’s tough. Since my divorce I’ve had a few dates and nothing’s panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public. Dating’s just not where I’m at lately."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/eminem-skipped-out-on-his-2003-oscar-win-and-regretted-it-afterwards.jpg><p>Eminem shared a similar perspective back in 2010 when he was interviewed by Rolling Stone. He said that being famous made dating challenging.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He explained, "I have trust issues. With women, friends, whatever. You always wonder what their real motives are. I’ve got a small circle of friends, and it’s a lot of the same friends I’ve known forever. Right now, that works for me. I came out of some difficult things these past couple of years. I kind of feel like I’m just now finding my footing. So I want to make sure that’s secure before I go out and do anything else. I need to keep working on myself for a while."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpqGemrpusddmrqKelWK4qrmMrJqorKRiuqLAx56prGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tbvDmrBo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./expensive-protection-services-for-the-rich-and-famous.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Expensive Protection Services For The Rich And Famous</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-cassidys-death-examined-in-autopsy-the-last-hours-of.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Cassidy's Death Examined in 'Autopsy...
