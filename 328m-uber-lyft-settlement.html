news outlet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WNBC covered the settlement</a>, and included a statement by Uber's chief legal officer Tony West.</p><p>West said the settlement "helps put to rest the classification issue in New York and moves us forward with a model that reflects the way people are increasingly choosing to work."</p><p>Jeremy Bird, chief policy officer for Lyft, was quoted as saying:</p><p>This is a win for drivers, and one we are proud to have achieved with the New York Attorney General’s Office.</p><p>Attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">represents "thousands" of Uber and Lyft drivers</a> according to Reuters. Regarding the New York State settlement, Liss-Riordan said:</p><p>This is huge ...

(The Black Car Fund is a New York state-backed surcharge to cover workers’ compensation and insurance). The investigation also accuses Uber of misrepresenting deductions made to drivers’ pay in their terms of service.</p><p>James’ office, meanwhile, accuses Lyft of similarly deducting an “administrative charge” from drivers’ payments from 2015 to 2017 in New York that was equal to the amount of sales tax and Black Car Fund fees that should have been paid by riders.</p><p>Reporting by the New York Times also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">addressed taxes and rideshare companies</a>, indicating the investigation was initiated partly for that reason:</p><p>The investigation began in 2020 after the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a group representing the drivers, made a complaint. The attorney general’s office focused on a period from 2014 to 2017 during which Uber was accused of deducting sales taxes and fees from drivers’ payments when they should have been paid by passengers.</p><p>From 2015 to 2017, Lyft similarly deducted an 11.4 percent “administrative charge” from drivers’ payments in New York equal to the amount of sales tax and fees that should have been paid by riders, the attorney general’s office said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the Times, Uber and Lyft drivers will accrue "one hour of sick pay for every 30 hours worked, up to 56 hours per year" under the terms of the settlement.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-4-million-speeding-ticket.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Georgia Man Got A $1.4 Million Speeding Ticket</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Georgia resident Connor Cato's $1.4 million speeding ticket was "not a typo," according county officials.</span><p>Finally, the Office of the Attorney General <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">(OAG)'s statement disclosed the terms of the settlement</a> in terms of specifics.</p><p>It explained that "Uber will pay $290 million and Lyft will pay $38 million into two separate settlement funds which will be entirely distributed to current and former drivers."</p><p>The statement explained that rideshare drivers "outside of New York City will receive a minimum of $26 per hour, adjusted annually for inflation, ensuring for the first time that the thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers working primarily outside of New York City will be guaranteed minimum pay" under the settlement.</p><p>Attorney General Letitia James was quoted in the press release. She began:</p><p>Rideshare drivers work at all hours of the day and night to take people wherever they need to go. For years, Uber and Lyft systematically cheated their drivers out of hundreds of millions of dollars in pay and benefits while they worked long hours in challenging conditions. These drivers overwhelmingly come from immigrant communities and rely on these jobs to provide for their families.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James continued, pledging to ensure all "gig economy" workers were protected under state labor laws and warning similar companies:</p><p>These settlements will ensure they finally get what they have rightfully earned and are owed under the law. My office will continue to make sure that companies operating in the so-called ‘gig economy’ do not deprive workers of their rights or undermine the laws meant to protect them.</p><p>Under the terms of a settlement announced on November 2nd, Uber and Lyft would pay a combined $328 million to current and former drivers in New York State. Per the OAG, eligible drivers could access the funds owed to them by filing a claim with James' office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmbGpoonq2rsSrZKWxlql6tLHTraOepZWjwXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-reasons-itd-be-fun-to-live-in-harry-potters-world-and-10-disadvantages.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Reasons It'd Be Fun To Live In Harry Potter's World (And 10 Disadvantages)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./barack-michelle-obama-buying-mega-mansion-marthas-vinyard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Barack and Michelle Obama Buying Mega-Mansion in Martha's Vineyard</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
