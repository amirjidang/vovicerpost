I just had a very low self-esteem,” the “On My Way” singer — who<a href=#> got engaged to<strong> Ben Affleck</strong> for a second time</a> earlier this year — admitted in the film.&nbsp;“I really believed a lot of what they said, which is I wasn’t any good. I wasn’t a good singer, I wasn’t a good actress, I wasn’t a good dancer. I wasn’t good at anything.”</p><p class=p1>The <i>Hustlers </i>actress also <a href=#>opened up about her dating history</a> in the doc — with a special cameo from the 49-year-old&nbsp;<i>Argo&nbsp;</i>director!&nbsp;<i>—&nbsp;</i>upon its Tuesday release.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Like, even now, I’m not gonna get into what my relationships were like.
