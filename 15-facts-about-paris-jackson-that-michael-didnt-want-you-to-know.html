And it is pretty obvious that his children also faced a massive amount of the media's attention. I cannot imagine how hard it must have been. On top of that, Michael Jackson was one of the most controversial figures of his time. All the scandals and dramas were always surrounding the King of Pop. It looks like people only let him have a rest after his death in 2009. Before that, he had to fight the media constantly. Would you want to be a kid of such a famous man? Well, <a href=#>Paris Jackson</a> had no choice. So, enough of Michael, and let's focus on his beautiful daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paris Jackson is all grown-up now. Even though everyone still associates her with Michael Jackson (it is the curse of kids of famous parents), Paris Jackson is proving to the world that she is a star on her own. Of course, like any other human being, Paris Jackson has her ups and downs, but in general, her life seems to be an inspiration. She has become a cover girl for Rolling Stone magazine earlier this year. It is an impressive achievement for an 18-year-old girl. Despite the fact that she is still facing some problems with self-esteem (who isn't?), Paris learned how to present herself in the brightest spotlight. Oh yes, she is capable of going all the way to the top!</p><h2 id=paris-jackson-has-problems-with-cyberbullies>15. Paris Jackson Has Problems With Cyberbullies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The internet has become a place where cowards can make fun of other people without any consequences. It is a shame, but that's how the world works. Sadly, Paris Jackson is also a victim of cyberbullying. She had a massive breakdown late in 2016, which she shared with her Instagram followers. Paris said: "I don't get why I am such an easy target. I try to be nice to everybody that I meet. I give everyone a chance." Well, Paris, that is probably the answer to your own question. Cyberbullies are afraid of mean and cold people. They always hit the ones who have the biggest hearts.</p><p>Haters are also a sign that Paris Jackson is doing some great things with her life. People are envious, and they bash the poor girl, but it will only help Paris become a stronger person in the long run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-taylor-and-macaulay-culkin-are-the-godparents-of-paris-jackson>14. Elizabeth Taylor And Macaulay Culkin Are The Godparents Of Paris Jackson</h2><p><a href=#>Elizabeth Taylor</a> and <a href=#>Macaulay Culkin</a> might be the best godparents' duo in the world. Both of them were good friends of Michael Jackson, so it is not a big surprise that MJ chose them to be the godparents of Paris Jackson, his only daughter. I can only imagine how cool it would be if my godparents were someone as famous as Elizabeth and Macaulay.</p><p>Of course, we must not forget all the controversy that surrounds the relationship between Michael Jackson and Macaulay Culkin. There are plenty of theories that MJ abused Macaulay as a kid. Of course, they spent a lot of time in Neverland Ranch but does it prove anything? I mean, what kind of world are we living in if a man cannot build a friendship with a kid without any acquisitions? All those conspiracy theories sound downright ridiculous, but haters gonna hate, right? So, all the drama aside, Paris Jackson is one lucky girl to have world-class godparents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-jackson-thinks-justin-bieber-might-end-up-like-her-father>13. Paris Jackson Thinks Justin Bieber Might End Up Like Her Father</h2><p>In her last interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Paris Jackson said that she is afraid that <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> will face the same fate as her father did. "He was tired, going through the motions. I looked at my ticket, saw AEG Live, and I thought back to how my dad was exhausted all the time but couldn't sleep." Justin Bieber replied that he is rested and feeling fine. Paris words make sense, though, especially, when we know the history of AEG Live and the Jackson family.</p><p>Jacksons' family sued AEG Live after Michael Jackson's death, blaming them for inhuman exploitation of Michael Jackson, which led to his death. AEG Live won the trial, but Paris Jackson still has her opinion about them: "AEG Live does not treat their performers right. They drain them dry and work them to death." That is the show business, folks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-jackson-attempted-suicide>12. Paris Jackson Attempted Suicide</h2><p>It might seem that Paris Jackson has everything that a girl needs. She is smart, beautiful, rich, and even influential. However, Paris Jackson has a lot of insecurities deep inside. Those insecurities, mixed with harsh haters' words and loneliness, led to a suicide attempt in 2013. Paris Jackson cut her wrists and swallowed 20 Motrin PM pills. Only God knows how she survived this tragedy, but it looks like she has changed her life ever since.</p><p>Paris Jackson is still fighting against her insecurities and openly talks about the problems that she has to face in her life. One of the most depressing things about Paris' life is the fact that her father is dead. The day when the world lost King of Pop, Paris suffered infinity times more. It is completely normal that even after four years of Michael Jackson's death, Paris couldn't cope with the loss. The only thing that matters is that she is doing much better today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-wore-masks-to-hide-from-the-public>11. Paris Wore Masks To Hide From The Public</h2><p>People can think whatever they want about Michael Jackson, but no one would ever dare to say that he was a bad father. Michael didn't want his kids to grow up the way he did, with all the attention from the bloodthirsty media. So, he made Paris Jackson wear a mask whenever she was in public places. Of course, it sounds like a very uncomfortable and a little freaky thing to do, but it was also a brilliant idea which saved Paris Jackson's childhood. Of course, all the fans were begging Michael Jackson to show the faces of his kids, but he refused. That was a farsighted father's decision.</p><p>Paris Jackson mentioned many times that she and her brothers could enjoy a very normal childhood because the media had no information about them. So, apart from wearing masks in public, Paris Jackson grew up just like any one of us. Well... almost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-jackson-spent-her-childhood-in-the-neverland-valley-ranch>10. Paris Jackson Spent Her Childhood In The Neverland Valley Ranch</h2><p>It was a dream of any kid back in the 90's to visit Neverland Ranch, the place where dreams come true at least for a day. Paris Jackson had the privilege to live there. Oh yes, she literally lived on the grounds of an amusement park, zoo, and a huge movie theater located a few steps away from her massive house. It was all hers. However, Paris Jackson stated many times that she couldn't just go and have fun whenever she wanted. Michael Jackson was a just father, so Paris had to earn the entertainments. That sounds pretty fair, right?</p><p>Paris Jackson lived in Neverland until the age of seven. By that time, she still did not know how famous and important her father was. Neverland was also only a home. However, when Paris reflects on her childhood, I bet she understand how lucky she was to live in a fantasy world, which cost $67 million.</p><h2 id=paris-is-crazy-about-tattoos>9. Paris Is Crazy About Tattoos</h2><p>It is probably impossible to stop inking yourself after you try it once. However, Paris Jackson has reached a whole another level. She has more than 50 tattoos all over her body. Remember, the girl is only 18-year-old! It is completely crazy! Paris Jackson commented her passion for the tattoos, saying: “The craftsmanship of tattoos will always be a controversy. Some people like them, some people absolutely hate them. I appreciate art, I always have, especially when that art means something to me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That something that Paris Jackson refers to is her father, Michael Jackson. Paris already has eight tattoos dedicated to the legacy of the King of Pop, and it looks like that it is not the end yet. The good thing, all the tattoos fit perfectly on Paris Jackson's body, adding charm to her already colorful personality.</p><h2 id=paris-jackson-was-sexually-assaulted-at-the-age-of-14>8. Paris Jackson Was Sexually Assaulted At The Age Of 14</h2><p>Sexual violence is the biggest crime against womankind, not to talk about a 14-year-old girl. It breaks my heart, knowing that some freak sexually assaulted Paris Jackson during her teen years. She said that it was one of the reasons why she tried to commit suicide. However, Paris Jackson did not want to talk about this experience. "I don't wanna give too many details. But it was not a good experience at all, and it was really hard for me, and, at the time, I didn't tell anybody."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of today, it seems like the guy who hurt Paris Jackson will walk free. The world is a crazy place, huh? Anyway, Paris needed four years before telling anyone about the trauma of the sexual assault. It really looks like she has found a way how to cope with the pain and live her life in happiness, and that is the only thing that matters now.</p><h2 id=paris-jackson-was-a-cheerleader>7. Paris Jackson Was A Cheerleader</h2><p>Paris Jackson always wanted to have a typical American girl life. She went to a high school with other kids and even became a cheerleader. I can only imagine how proud Paris' high school must have been to have such an iconic cheerleader. Anyway, Paris Jackson once again proved that she was capable of reaching any of her goals. Yes, cheerleading might not sound like the hardest thing to do, but it still requires a lot of motivation, discipline, and energy.</p><p>On top of her cheerleading career, Paris Jackson also played on the softball, volleyball, and football teams. That is a lot of teams to be part of. So, even Paris Jackson, the daughter of the King of Pop, had to sweat in the gym to get such a stunning figure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-jackson-plays-drums-and-piano>6. Paris Jackson Plays Drums And Piano</h2><p>Paris Jackson stated a lot of times that she wants to try herself as a musician. Her genes are just perfect for that as well. I mean, she is the daughter of Michael Jackson! Many skeptics say that her name is the only reason why she is so popular, but Paris is proving them wrong with her actions. By the age of 18, she can already play the drums, and also taught herself to play guitar. That is the best way to shut up the critics! Of course, people will compare her to Michael Jackson all the time, and let's be honest; she has a very slim chance of reaching her father's level. However, so does everybody else in the world.</p><p>So, Paris Jackson is earning her name as a young and promising artist. The Jackson name can carry Paris Jackson on in the entertainment business for a while, but eventually, it is the talent and hard work that matters. Hopefully, Paris Jackson has what it takes to become the Queen of Pop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-jackson-believes-that-her-father-was-killed>5. Paris Jackson Believes That Her Father Was Killed</h2><p>The world lost a legend on June 25, 2009. Over 31.3 million people watched the memorial service for Michael Jackson. That is how much he meant to the world. However, Paris Jackson and her family were the ones that cried the most that day. Oh yes, Paris lost a father that day, and nothing hurts more than the loss of a family member.</p><p>Till this day, many people cannot agree what the cause of Michael Jackson's death was. Officially, his personal physician Conrad Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter for subscribing Michael too much propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam. However, Paris Jackson has different thoughts. She stated many times that her father was afraid of 'bad' people who were after him. Yes, Paris Jackson believes that her father's death was a carefully planned murder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-jackson-dated-chester-castellaw>4. Paris Jackson Dated Chester Castellaw</h2><p>It is such a shame that celebrities cannot have their private life and date whoever they want without any attention from the media. However, can anything else be more intriguing than finding out who dates who in the show business? In 2015, paparazzi caught Paris Jackson in a company of Chester Castellaw, a professional soccer player. The internet exploded trying to figure out if they were dating or just friends.</p><p>They were dating. Sadly, the relationship between Paris and Chester didn't last. The couple got together early in 2015 and separated at the end of that same year. Chester Castellaw even deleted all the photos of Paris Jackson from his social media platforms. That made Paris feel even more depressed. Oh, the pain of the loss of the first love! Don't worry, Paris Jackson is alright already.</p><h2 id=the-famous-speech-at-dad-s-funeral>3. The Famous Speech At Dad's Funeral</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paris Jackson was only 11 years old when her father passed away. Naturally, she could not handle her emotions during the funeral. Not in front of millions of people, anyway. When she took the microphone to give the speech, all the world went silent. That exact moment when Paris Jackson started talking and crying, the world cried with her.</p><p>“I just want to say… Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine. And I just want to say I love him… so much.” It was all that Paris Jackson could say at that moment, and it was enough. Everyone could see that she had a great connection with her father. People had no doubts that Paris Jackson meant every word she said. Her speech still brings tears to my eyes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-jackson-is-a-singer-and-songwriter>2. Paris Jackson Is A Singer And Songwriter</h2><p>Michael Jackson would be proud to see Paris Jackson all grown up and talented. Paris is already writing songs, and people are happy to see that she is following in the footsteps of her father. On top of that, Paris Jackson is not shy to sing those songs herself. Yes, it might not be the most powerful voice ever, but she is only 18 and still has a lot of time to improve. Oh, what am I trying to fool? Paris already has a very distinctive voice.</p><p>So often singers struggle in the industry because they lack charisma. Paris Jackson doesn't have this problem. Her looks captivate, and even a blind man could see her talent. Of course, it is impossible to predict the future, but Paris Jackson definitely has what it takes to be a star.</p><h2 id=paris-jackson-wants-to-be-a-heart-surgeon>1. Paris Jackson Wants To Be A Heart Surgeon</h2><p>In 2013, Paris Jackson said: "I want to go to medical school and be a doctor specializing in heart surgery. I want to help people." That is a very sweet thing to say for a girl of her age. That shows us how decent and kind Paris Jackson grew up. I mean, it was pretty easy for her to become a spoiled girl who only cares about her needs. However, that is not the case with Paris. Of course, at this stage of her life, when Paris' career in show business is kicking-off, it is pretty hard to believe that she would now choose a path of a heart surgeon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You know what? It does not matter if she does or doesn't become a heart surgeon. As long as Paris Jackson will live by her "I want to help people" motto, she will do just fine anywhere in the world. Oh yes, there are never enough kind and compassionate people, especially, not in the show business, where people have the power to influence others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2brqTA0maYm6elqXqxrdGiqmaikZi4tLvNZquhmaRiuqqvx5qcpWWUnrGvwIywmKesXa68tnnTqGSkpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-things-girls-obsess-over-but-guys-couldnt-care-less.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Things Girls Obsess Over (But Guys Couldn't Care Less)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stephenie-meyer-facts-surprising-author-twilight-books-movies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Things You Didn't Know About The Twilight Writer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
