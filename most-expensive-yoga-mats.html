This company was founded in 1999 and makes very well&nbsp;crafted sustainable handmade&nbsp;mats.</p><p>The yoga mat is handmade from vegan materials including synthetic leather and soft fleece. It is also stuffed with lavender flowers, which can make your practice nicely scented. The mats are lightweight, portable and an additional bonus is that they are washable.</p><h2 id=maati-maati-yoga-mat---250>Maati Maati Yoga Mat - $250</h2><p>If you're a sustainable yogi, check out the Maati Maati yoga mat. It's made from natural cork from Portugal.

If the black mat doesn't suit you, there is also a leopard print version you can take home for €345 (around $360).</p><h2 id=liforme-x-burberry---420>Liforme x Burberry - $420</h2><p>If you happen to be in the market for a&nbsp;well-made mat, with a design that is both sleek and utilitarian, look no further. Liforme's recent collaboration with Burberry is a simple, sturdy&nbsp;mat equipped with the AlignForMe alignment guides that are on all of Liforme's yoga mats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This mat is non-slip and extra comfy. Liforme mats were developed over&nbsp;a period of 5&nbsp;years by an entertainment lawyer who also practices yoga. They're designed for both comfort and utility, so users can really find their body in the pose.</p><h2 id=ermenegildo-zegna---500>Ermenegildo Zegna - $500</h2><p>The illustrious Ermenegildo Zegna brand was born in Trivero, Northern Italy in 1910.&nbsp;The company&nbsp;has since grown massively in the public eye and is now considered one of the most influential brands&nbsp;in luxury men's attire.
