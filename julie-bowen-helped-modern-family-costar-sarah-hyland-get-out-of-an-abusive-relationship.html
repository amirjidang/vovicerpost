I’m sure another responsible adult would have done the exact same thing. I just love her,” said Bowen on Monday’s <a href=# rel=noopener>“Him & Her Podcast.”</a></p><p>In September 2014, Hyland, best known for playing eldest Dunphy daughter, Haley, was granted a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend, <strong>Matt Prokop</strong>, who she accused of physical and verbal abuse during their five-year relationship.</p><p>In court documents obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a> at the time, Hyland claimed Prokop once pinned her against a car and choked her.</p><p>“His grip was so tight that I could not breathe or speak. I was scared and in fear for my life,” she said in the documents, adding that she had a “very sore throat following this event.”</p><p>Hyland also said in the docs that she enlisted Bowen to help her “peacefully end the relationship.” She invited her onscreen mom to her house as she tried to break up with Prokop, but alleged her ex became angry at the sight of other people and “ran outside into the backyard and began screaming.” Bowen also witnessed Prokop throw a lighter at Hyland, at which point she told the young actress to leave the house because she wasn’t safe around Prokop, the docs said.</p><p>On the “Him & Her Podcast,” Bowen said that it’s not just Hyland that she’d jump to defend — but her other onscreen children, <strong>Ariel Winter</strong> (Alex Dunphy) and <a href=#><strong>Nolan Gould</strong></a> (Luke Dunphy), too.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I look at her, and Ariel, and Nolan and — well, Rico [Rodriguez, who played Manny] was always like an adult, a tiny adult — but, yeah, I look at them all like my kids. I love them,” she said.</p><p>Modern Family aired for 11 seasons from 2009 to 2020 on ABC.</p><p>If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support. <a href=# rel=noopener>https://www.thehotline.org/</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajrZyesm6uzrCcp2WYmrmxscNmpKiclae7brLApqClsV2YvLTAwKtkrJmilrVutNilmKecXZyytXnOrqtmp5Zirq95wJusrKGmmnqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./orlando-bloom-salary-for-lord-of-the-rings-compared-to-gran-turismo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Orlando Bloom Made More Than Triple The Salary Of All Three Lord Of The Rings Films Combined For Gra</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-gordon-and-constance-martens-baby-missing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Gordon And Constance Marten Baby Missing What Have They Done?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
