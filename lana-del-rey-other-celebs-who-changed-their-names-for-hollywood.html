According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheTalko</a>, she changed her name for the specific reason of having a name that sounded more Hollywood. Laura Jeanne is an old-fashioned sounding name while Reese sounds free, fun, and fresh. Cutting off those first two names made a world of a difference.</p><h2 id=nina-dobrev---nikolina-konstantinova-dobreva><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><b>Nina Dobrev -&nbsp;Nikolina Konstantinova Dobreva</b></span></h2><p class=p2>Who would have thought that <a href=#>Nina Dobrev</a>'s real name was actually<b>&nbsp;</b>Nikolina Konstantinova Dobreva? She knew her name was super long so she decided to trim it down a bit and make it easier for others to say.

She kept her last name intact but mode away from her first name entirely. She trimmed her middle name, Lucille, down to Lucy. This was an incredibly smart move for Lucy Hale since her name is so unforgettable. It is short, sweet, and to the point. When she told the crowd during a&nbsp;<span class=s1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i>Jimmy Fallon</i></a>&nbsp;interview, everyone was very surprised.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=nicki-minaj---onika-tanya-maraj><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><b>Nicki Minaj -&nbsp;Onika Tanya Maraj</b></span></h2><p class=p2><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>'s real name is&nbsp;Onika Tanya Maraj. The famous rapper decided to change her name because she knew it would help her on her path to superstardom. It worked and she was right-- although with all of her talent, she would have made it big regardless of what name she used. Nicki Minaj is known for releasing some of the catchiest rap music that crosses over into the pop category often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lana-del-rey---elizabeth-woolridge-grant><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><b>Lana Del Rey -&nbsp;Elizabeth Woolridge Grant</b></span></h2><p class=p2>True <a href=#>Lana Del Rey</a> stans already know that Lana Del Rey's real name is Elizabeth Woolridge Grant.

Her real name and new name are so very different... it sort of makes people wonder where the new name came from?! Apparently, she was so inspired by William Shakespeare that she decided to change her name to a fictional character he'd written up in his play The Merchant of Venice.
