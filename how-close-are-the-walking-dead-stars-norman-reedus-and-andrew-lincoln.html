For example, who among us hasn’t found themselves wishing that the actors that brought their favorite onscreen couples to life found love in one another’s arms in real-life?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, there are endless examples of actors whose characters care deeply about one another even though they are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">behind-the-scenes enemies</a>. On the bright side, some co-stars have developed intense bonds during their time working together and have gone on to become lifelong friends in real-life.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, The Walking Dead has aired ten seasons and fans have gotten to watch five seasons of Fear the Walking Dead. Even though the two shows have aired so many hours of television and featured so many characters, there is little doubt that the franchise’s best friends have been Rick Grimes and Daryl Dixon. As the two actors that brought those characters to life, it makes sense that fans want to know whether or not Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus are pals away from the cameras.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayim Bialik And Jim Parsons: What We Know About Their Real-Life Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=becoming-megastars-together>Becoming Megastars Together</h2><p>Years before Norman Reedus began starring in The Walking Dead, he first rose to prominence when he starred in one of the biggest cult movies of all-time, The Boondock Saints. After that initial success, Reedus went on to show up in a slew of TV shows and movies like Blade II, Deuces, Wild, and American Gangster. On top of the people who love Norman Reedus for his acting roles, there also are legions that adore him since he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seems like such a great guy in real-life</a>.</p><p>For his part, Andrew Lincoln’s biggest claim to pre-The Walking Dead fame was his leading role in the movie Love Actually. A film that has gone on to be seen as a Christmas classic, unfortunately for Lincoln, most people believe his character’s storyline is quite creepy today for good reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though it is undeniable that Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus were both successful already before they starred in The Walking Dead, the show took their careers to another level. After all, it can easily be argued that at the height of its popularity, The Walking Dead had one of the most passionate fan bases in television.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Walking Dead: Ranking The Saddest Scenes In The Show’s History</a></span></p><h2 id=real-life-relationship>Real-Life Relationship</h2><p>Given the fact that the average public doesn’t get to see what goes on behind-the-scenes of their favorite TV shows, they often are left wondering whether or not co-stars get along. In the case of Norman Reedus and Andrew Lincoln, however, the two actors made it clear that they were the best of friends during their time starring in The Walking Dead.</p><p>If you are looking for surface-level evidence of how close Norman Reedus and Andrew Lincoln are, you can look at the many examples of the two men embracing. Of course, both men have lots of people they care about, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Norman Reedus’ friendship with Lady Gaga</a>, so you may want to see more proof that the guys have been pals for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, one of the best indicators of their friendship is the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus love pranking each other</a>. For example, there was the time that Reedus tried to force a bunch of goats into Lincoln’s trailer. Even better, Lincoln once asked Reedus to teach him how to say thank you for having me in your country in Japanese. Instead, Reedus tricked Lincoln into asking ‘Where’s the toilet?’ on live TV. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A great prankster himself</a>, Andrew Lincoln has poured glitter on Reedus on multiple occasions and he once toilet papered his friend’s car.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprising Facts About Norman Reedus’ Private Life</a></span></p><h2 id=lincoln-s-exit-leaves-a-huge-hole-behind>Lincoln’s Exit Leaves A Huge Hole Behind</h2><p>Even though Norman Reedus is a big star, he is a human being just like the rest of us so it makes sense that he was sad when his good friend Andrew Lincoln left The Walking Dead. An extremely open person, Reedus has talked about how he struggled to cope with the change and something he kept around to make himself feel a little bit better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking about returning to work knowing that Lincoln was gone</a>, Norman Reedus told the ABC News show Popcorn; “I remember the day he left – I got my lunch, I went back in my trailer and it was just so depressing”. As it turns out, Lincoln left something behind. “The chair that he always sat on, he had left sort of an imprint of his body in (fake) blood on it; the shroud of Rick Grimes.” “They came in to clean it up and I’m like, ‘Leave it there!’”</p><p>Willing to say that he “didn’t agree” with Andrew Lincoln’s decision to leave The Walking Dead during that same interview, Norman Reedus still defended his pal’s choice. “I understood why he left. He lives in England. He’s got, two little kids. He wasn’t seeing his kids as much as he would like. For him, I think his wife was like, ‘It’s time. You’ve been there a long time’.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times Norman Reedus And Andrew Lincoln Were Relationship Goals</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXam1pnnWmqOkoZ6ceqWxwJ1krKyRp8Buus6rpJqmXaeyprDUrGSappRirq%2Bw0Z6uZqSZo7CwuM1o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-devante-swing-make-latest-devante-swing-net-worth-income-salary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does DeVante Swing Make?
