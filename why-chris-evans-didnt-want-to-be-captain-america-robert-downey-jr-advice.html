They wanted an American for the role, as well as someone who was funny and charming. "But then beyond the obvious qualities, I think there were the other ones that were a little harder to discern: his humility, the sense that he had a moral compass, that he was very relatable. He has this vulnerability as well as strength, so we could take him from skinny Steve to Captain America," the casting director for the MCU admitted.</p><p>Evans knew that saying yes to the role was "the right thing to do," but he had turned it down twice prior and felt good about his decision to do so. So why did Chris Evans turn down a role so many actors would have dreamed of landing?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Chris-Evans.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Look Into Chris Evans' Acting Career Outside Marvel</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Chris Evans is easily recognized as Marvel's Captain America, but his acting career consists of much more than superheroes.</span><p>“I like my privacy. The good thing about movies is there’s a lot of freedom built in: you make a film and then you have time off. If one of those films hits and changes your life, you have the opportunity to . . . run away," he admitted.</p><p>Another reason the Snowpiercer actor was concerned about the job was because the contract forced him into making nine movies. To entice Evans into the role, Marvel Studios rolled back his contract to six movies: three Captain America movies and three Avengers films. Although being locked into playing the character for a decade was scary, he decided, “maybe the thing you’re most scared of is actually the thing you should do.”</p><h2 id=did-chris-evans-make-a-mistake-appearing-in-captain-america>Did Chris Evans Make A Mistake Appearing In Captain America?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51797477-1.jpg><p>After taking so long to say yes to the role of Steve Rogers, Chris Evans regretted it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He joined the role at a crucial point in his life. “I remember in my late 20s having a real shift in how I felt on set, how I felt promoting films: a little more anxiety, a little more uncertainty."</p><p>The Ghosted star admits that he was questioning what he wanted to do in his life, worrying that the entertainment industry "wasn't healthy." Evans initially worried playing Captain America could make him "deeply, deeply unhappy," but luckily he ultimately found solace in the role. “I love playing that role,” he explained to GQ.</p><p>“I feel connected to it in a way that when you revisit a character so many times you can’t help but try to absorb some of their traits and measure yourself against them.”</p><p>In the recent GQ interview, Chris Evans admitted the experience was mostly positive for him. “Without these movies, I wouldn’t be directing.

He bowed out of the role during Avengers: Endgame but he still has a "never say never," attitude about coming back to the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evans has admitted that he doesn't want to tarnish his legacy by returning to the role of the super soldier. “It’s something that I am very proud of. And, like I said, sometimes I can’t believe it even happened," but has added that he "wouldn’t want the black eye if it felt like a cash grab, or if it didn’t live up to expectations, or if it just felt like it wasn’t connected to that original thing."</p><p>In fact, Evans is looking to pull back from his career in Hollywood. “If I’m acting at all, it’s going to be under Marvel contract, or I’m going to be directing. I can’t see myself pursuing acting strictly outside what I’m contractually obligated to do.” <a href=#>Anthony Mackie will be taking over the role</a> in the upcoming fourth Captain America movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Evans admits that he may change his mind in the future.“For all I know, in five years, I might say, ‘S***, I miss acting…right now, I just want to get behind the camera and make movies.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLWztdJmnK%2BZnqh6pbXDp6tmr5GjwW7AzmaZnmWTlr21rcinZJqllae2pK2Mq6abnaKpeqW71qecsmWap3qisNWimp5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./650-million-yacht-future-green-luxury-boating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why This $650 Million Yacht Will Lead The Future In Green Luxury Boating</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-yesenia-vega-kitt-new-york-pastry-chef-slammed-for-anti-semitic-remarks-692991-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Yesenia Vega-Kitt?
