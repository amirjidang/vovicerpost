The rapper and entrepreneur saw great success in both industries, and his family wants that to remain as the status quo. After his tragic murder in 2019, he left a legacy behind, and that is something that his estate holds near and dear. Determined to preserve what Nipsey had created, those responsible for his estate are launching a lawsuit against anyone and everyone that is responsible for counterfeit merchandise bearing the name of his brand, and they'll stop at nothing to ensure this behavior is discontinued. In fact, TMZ reports that many of the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">counterfeit products are linked to companies in China,</a> and they're now being slapped with huge fines and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aggressive litigation</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Perry Debuts 'Friends' Clothing Line To Aid COVID 19 Relief Efforts</a></span></p><p>Nipsey Hussle, and now subsequently, his estate, own the rights to Marathon Clothing, inclusive of their affiliate relationship with Puma, along with other brands and labels. Since his death, many companies have created counterfeit merchandise bearing Nipsey's name, likeness, and brand name, all in an effort to monopolize on profits.</p><p>Wrongly using his brand and image for their own gain, and without the proper license to reproduce these products, these bootleg shops are now under fire, as Nipsey's estate takes <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aggressive legal action </a>to secure his legacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TMZ reports that, "The late rapper's brother and estate administrator, Samiel Asghedom, just filed suit against several entities that the estate believes are behind a bunch of e-commerce websites selling knockoff Marathon-related clothing," and they went on to say that the estate has the rights to a number of the registered trademarks, "including a Crenshaw logo for clothing, another clothing line called South Central State of Mind" and many others.</p><p>Asghedom indicates that these websites and online outlets did not obtain consent or license to duplicate these items, thus igniting a legal battle to rectify this issue. He has traced back some illegal activity in the state of Illinois and is continuing his hunt for anyone that tries to exploit Nipsey in this manner.</p><p>If proven to be guilty, these organizations will be hit hard, as Nipsey's estate is seeking rights to all their domain registrations and rights to all their profits resulting from merchandise sales and the use of the trademarks in all capacities. Proving that they really mean business, their legal documents indicate they are seeking compensation to the tune of $2 million per illegal infraction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slaying Swimwear Sales: Elizabeth Hurley Models In Her Own Swimwear Line</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e82ip6ydqWK1tr%2FSpZysZZWowaLAxGaqrp2jYrCwuc%2BapaKdo2LAprjLoqWgZZujvKS3jKidn6tdpLNutMisZJykn6m1qrrGZpmrmZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1190954-njpw-announces-four-new-events-for-the-summer-2020-schedule.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NJPW Announces Four New Events For The Summer 2020 Schedule</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-trudell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-71234-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Trudell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
