We got the autopsy report about a month ago,” she continued. “It was just a bad accident with [the umbilical] cord mixed with some swallowed placenta. But I’m doing much better. And, you know, I have my husband. He’s amazing. My kids are great. They, you know, keep me going and I have work and I’m busy, so I don’t have time to sit and cry all day long.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Selling-Sunset-Maya-Vander-Is-Doing-Much-Better-After-Delivering-Stillborn-Son-3.jpg><p>The real estate mogul revealed via Instagram in December 2021 that <a href=#>she suffered a stillbirth</a> after <a href=#>announcing her pregnancy</a> that July. “I always heard of it but never imagined I’ll be part of the statistics,” she wrote at the time.</p><p>Maya told Us Weekly exclusively that month that <a href=#>she had “no crazy symptoms”</a> throughout her third pregnancy. “I felt less movement a few days prior,” she recalled. “I went to a private ultrasound check and <a href=#>everything was fine</a> and looked normal. … I delivered a normal baby that looked like he was sleeping.
