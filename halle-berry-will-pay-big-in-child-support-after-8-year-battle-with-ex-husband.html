Additionally, she mut allocate to him "4.3% of any income she receives above $2,000,000" as supplementary support.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears Buys A New Puppy After Settling Custody Of Her Dogs With Sam Asghari</a></span></p><p>Moreover, the actress must take on financial responsibility for her son's private school tuition, uniforms, and educational materials, along with any extracurricular costs. Halle also agreed to reimburse Martinez for any of these expenditures incurred during the 2023/2024 academic year.</p><p>Halle and Olivier filed for divorce in 2015 following only two years of marriage. The pair have been engaged in a legal battle, primarily over co-parenting, ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It is with a heavy heart that we have come to the decision to divorce,” the pair said in a joint statement when announcing their divorce. “We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus of what is best for our son. We wish each other nothing but happiness in life and we hope that you respect our and, most importantly, our children’s privacy as we go through this difficult period.”</p><p>This isn’t the only custody and child support arrangement Halle recently settled. In May, <a href=#>Halle was victorious in a dispute spanning a decade</a> with her former partner, Gabriel Aubry, over their daughter, Nahla, now 15.</p><p>Back in 2014, a judge ruled that the actress was obligated to provide her ex-partner, Gabriel Aubry, with $16,000 in child support for their 15-year-old daughter, Nahla. Nevertheless, Halle decided to contest this decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, she achieved a minor triumph as the court approved a 50% reduction in her child support obligations, lowering her monthly payments to Gabriel to $8,000. However, alongside this adjustment, Halle was also instructed to allocate 4.3% of any yearly earnings surpassing $1.96 million to him.</p><p>Most recently, the court has reached an accord to establish a maximum limit on this sum, with the cap set at $4.5 million for supplementary yearly child support.</p><p>“Halle shall continue to pay Gabriel 4.3% of any income she receives above $1.95 million, as and for additional child support for Nahla,” <a href=#>court documents obtained by Daily Mail reveal</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“However, any additional payments of child support pursuant to this Paragraph shall not exceed $109,650 per year, which is the difference between 4.3% of $1.95 million and $4.5 million,” the documents continue. “The parties agree that additional child support over and above $109,650 per year would exceed Nahla's reasonable needs.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kim Zolciak & Daughter Brielle Sued Over Massive Unpaid Credit Card Bills</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1orjLnmSbnaKnxm7DyKWjZqiRrnqjtcZmoKdlk522rbCMrKypqJ%2BnwW6txa2cq2VoYsamrdFmmZqspKGybsPIrZ9mnahitba%2FwZqlnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-why-cop-shows-have-a-larger-responsibility-than-just-entertainment.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Cop Shows Have A Larger Responsibility Than Just Entertainment</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gerard-pique-clara-chias-relationship-timeline-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gerard Pique, Clara Chia's Relationship Timeline: Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
