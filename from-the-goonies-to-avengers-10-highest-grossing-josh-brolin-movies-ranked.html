At 53 years old, Brolin has an acting resume extensive enough to make Kris Kristofferson jealous. He is legendary for playing gritty, criminal antagonist roles, such as a drug-dealing detective in American Gangster, Dwight McCarthy in Sin City, and a crooked boat tour guide named Bates in Into The Blue. His name has become synonymous with <a href=#>Thanos</a> from Marvel's Avengers franchise and he has reprised his role as the supervillain in all the Avengers franchises. Here are 10 of the highest-grossing movies throughout Josh Brolin's career.</p><h2 id=avengers-endgame>Avengers: Endgame</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Marvel Studios production team kept fans on their feet in 2018 with the release of <a href=#>Avengers: Infinity War</a> in 2018, where Josh Brolin's enigmatic character in Thanos was first introduced. Thanos' reign of terror has resulted in Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) being displaced in outer space after the destructive demigod destroyed more than half the life in the universe. The rest of the Avengers gang, consisting of Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff (<a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>), and James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), must now traverse time and space to attempt to reverse the universal chaos caused by Thanos. Avengers: Endgame was the last major Marvel Universe movie series released before the pandemic, and grossed a monumental figure of $2.797 billion at the box office.</p><h2 id=avengers-infinity-war>Avengers: Infinity War</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Tony Stark (<a href=#>Robert Downey Jr.</a>), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and the Avengers crew bought quite a bit of excitement to the Marvel Universe, when Thanos came on the scene, it was a total gamechanger. In the Avengers: Infinity War of 2018, he embarks on a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, and, despite the resistance of the Avengers, decimates half the life in the universe. Sourced from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Spy</a>, Josh Brolin once admitted in a podcast that if Thanos wasn't the character chosen for him to play, he wouldn't have chosen the role of any other superhero. He said, "But the fact that it was all the Avengers against this one guy. I liked that aspect of it." It appears Brolin has a bit of lone wolf inside of him. <a href=#>Avengers: Infinity War</a> was also a box office hit, grossing $2.048 billion internationally.</p><h2 id=deadpool-2>Deadpool 2</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By now it's no secret that Josh Brolin has a knack for playing a convincing villainous role. And he reiterated his potential for such once again in 2018 with the release of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadpool 2.</a> The first installment of Deadpool in 2016 introduced the Special Forces operative-turned-mercenary as Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds). We learned that he received his extraordinary healing powers after being intentionally disfigured by the evil scientist Ajax (Ed Skrein). In <a href=#>Deadpool 2</a>, Deadpool meets a teenage mutant named Russell who soon becomes the target of a genetically enhanced supersoldier named Cable (Josh Brolin). Realizing he can't save the boy from Cable on his own, Deadpool joins forces with Domino (Zazie Beetz), Bedlam (Terry Cruz), and Shatterstar (Lewis Tan). The film was highly anticipated by fans and grossed $786.3 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=men-in-black-3>Men In Black 3</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The unlikely-paired planet protectors against malevolent forces, Agent J (<a href=#>Will Smith</a>) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) come back for their third and final installment of the extraterrestrial sci-fi/action film in Men In Black 3. It's been a few years since Agent J has been hand-selected to combat monstrous galactic creatures. This time, they're up against a fiend named Boris the Animal (<a href=#>Jemaine Clement</a>), the last remaining Boglodite, who escaped from a prison on the Moon to seek vengeance on Agent K for dismembering his left arm and capturing him. Agent K also deployed "ArcNet," which is a shield that prevents the Boglodites from subduing the earth, eventually causing their extinction. Boris plans to go back in time to kill the younger version of Agent K (Josh Brolin) in order to change his miserable fate. The film grossed a total of $654.2 million at the box office.</p><h2></h2><h2 id=dune>Dune</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of<a href=#> Brolin's</a> most recent movies, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dune</a>, was released in 2021 with a cast of brilliant actors to produce the masterpiece it has become. The sci-fi action and adventure film focus on a young man named Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) who is to fulfill a destiny far beyond his own understanding. After being put through a series of trials and tests, he proves ready to receive all that awaits him. Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) is one of his mentors, as is his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Paul is troubled by dreams of a morbid future, but in one of those dreams, he sees a stunning young lady named Chani (<a href=#>Zendaya</a>) who he believes is part of his journey. With special spotlights on actors like Jason Momoa, the film grossed $398.6 million at the global box office.</p><h2 id=american-gangster>American Gangster</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>American Gangster</a> has undoubtedly become one of the most iconic gangster flicks of all time. The movie was meant to be a biographical crime depiction of the life of Frank Lucas, played by <a href=#>Denzel Washington</a>. Brolin's role is that of the crooked police chief, Detective Trupo, who demands a cut from Frank's heroin business, sensing the success of Lucas's premium opium product. Detective Trupo is finally brought down for his corruption and, on the other side of the law, good cop Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is obsessed with bringing down one of the largest criminal organizations of the 1970s. Actos included in the film range from Chiwetel Ejiofor, Cuba Gooding Jr., Idris Elba, and <a href=#>rapper T.I.</a> The movie was such as success that even Jay-Z produced some of the movie's soundtrack, grossing $267.9 million worldwide.</p><h2 id=true-grit>True Grit</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the 1968 novel by Charles Portis of the same name, True Grit 2010 is a movie adaptation centering on the life of a fourteen-year-old girl named Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) whose father is murdered while on a horse-purchasing trip to Arkansas. The murder suspect in question who accompanied her father is Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who the local sheriff informs Mattie has fled with another suspect, "Lucky" Ned Pepper (<a href=#>Barry Pepper</a>). Compelled by the need to avenge her father's death, Mattie raised money to hire a U.S. Marshall, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). However, Chaney is also being pursued by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) for the murder of a Texas State Senator. Together, their true grit and persistence are tested in bringing a shameless killer to justice. The Western crime/drama grossed a little over $250 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=everest>Everest</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 2015 adventure and thriller, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everest</a>, may have a similar setting to that of 1993's Cliffhanger, but this movie is in a different category to <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone's</a> action movie. There is an element of reality to the film, being based on the actual events of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster of May 10-11 1996. Two expedition groups, one led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), and the other by Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) brave the fiercest conditions in a blistering blizzard in their attempt to reach the summit of <a href=#>Mount Everest</a>. Josh Brolin takes on the role of an experienced American doctor named Beck Weathers, while Robin Wright acts as Beck's wife, Peach Weathers. The real-life film grossed a whopping $221.2 million at the worldwide box office.</p><h2 id=hollow-man>Hollow Man</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Hollow Man was released in 2000, the sci-fi/horror was an instant blockbuster success. 22 years ago, $191 million was a hefty sum of money for a film to gross at the international box office, which was the overall earning figure of Hollow Man. The film was also inspired by a novel written by H.G. Wells in 1897 entitled The Invisible Man. Its storyline describes a brilliant but arrogant scientist named Sebastian Caine (<a href=#>Kevin Bacon</a>) who develops the ultimate military serum that does more than camouflages its subject; it makes them invisible. His team includes his ex-girlfriend Linda McKay (<a href=#>Elisabeth Shue</a>), her new boyfriend Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin), Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens), Carter Abbey (Greg Grunberg), Frank Chase (Joey Slotnick), and Janice Walton (Mary Randle). When Caine decides to test his discovery on himself, it's a success, and he is completely invisible. However, his jealousy and rage get the better of him, and he begins killing his own teammates, one by one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-country-for-old-men>No Country For Old Men</h2><p>The Wild West has been known for its brazen shootouts and lawless principles, which is why its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No Country for Old Men</a>, like the film, suggests. Released in 2007, the film follows a hunter named Llewelyn Moss (<a href=#>Josh Brolin</a>) who stumbles upon the gruesome scene of a deadly drug deal gone bad. Among his findings were several dead bodies, both animal and human, drugs, and a briefcase with two million dollars. Against his better judgment, Moss takes the money, only to find that he is soon chased by a truck. Sensing the danger he is in, Moss orders his wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) to stay with her mother. Anton Chigurh (<a href=#>Javier Bardem</a>), a hitman hired to recover the money, relentlessly pursues Moss, in addition to Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who is seeking to protect Moss. The gripping film grossed $164 million at the box office and was well received by viewers for its grim and exciting experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Facts Even True Fans Don't Remember About Josh Brolin's Cable</a></strong></span></p><p><span class=next-single><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>Inside Josh Brolin's Luxurious $3.25 Million Atlanta Mansion&nbsp;</a></strong></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Spy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinema Blend</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RogerEbert.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slashfilm.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSzs7vMZquhnV2cvLC6yJ6qZqyfYq63sc2gnKurXWZ9brTIoJ%2Beq6RitLO70qygp59dn7y0tIybqaikmaN6rrvVopysZaKWu6yxw2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stephenie-meyer-facts-surprising-author-twilight-books-movies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Things You Didn't Know About The Twilight Writer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebs-who-overcame-homelessness.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Celebs Who Overcame Homelessness</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
