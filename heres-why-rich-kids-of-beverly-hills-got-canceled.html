There's <a href=#>one big unforgettable RHOBH scene</a> that is still on everyone's radar, not to mention countless arguments that fans still talk about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's another reality series set in the same wealthy city and that's Rich Kids of Beverly Hills which aired on the E! Network. Unlike the Real Housewives franchise and other <a href=#>reality shows on the air for years</a>, this one only lasted four seasons.</p><p>Why did the show get canceled? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=goodbye-39-rich-kids-of-beverly-hills-39>Goodbye 'Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills'</h2><p>When the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reality show got canceled after four seasons</a>, it sounds like the cast wanted to film another season.</p><p>According to Entertainment Tonight, a source explained, "The cast was upset because they wanted at least one more season to give closure to their storylines. The cast is thankful though for the opportunity they had and the show wished them all the best as they move on to the next chapter of their lives."</p><p>It was definitely surprising to see that the show wasn't returning for season 5 and according to Bustle.com, it would have made sense if the show did get renewed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An official reason for cancelling the show wasn't given, but since shows are typically cancelled if the ratings dip or if there isn't enough public interest, perhaps that is why.</p><p>According to The Wrap, the reality show did well at first: one episode that aired in 2014 had 1.25 million viewers and 785,000 viewers in the 18-49 demographic that is crucial for advertisers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What ‘RHOBH’ Was Originally Supposed To Look Like</a></span></p><h2></h2><h2 id=the-show>The Show</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rich Kids of Beverly Hills is like many other reality shows that follow a group of friends, but this time, the cast members are incredibly wealthy. The show looks at the lives of Dorothy Wang, Morgan Stewart, Brendan Fitzpatrick, EJ Johnson, Roxy Sowlaty, Bianca Espada, and Taylor-Ann Hasselhoff, and Jonny Drubel. There aren't very many episodes, as season 1 has 9 episodes, season 2 has 10, and seasons 3 and 4 have only 8.</p><p>It's interesting to learn about how the parents of these young adults made their money, as the show focuses on how these cast members have grown up very rich and privileged.</p><p>According to Bustle, Morgan Stewart's dad, Herb Stewart, has a company called H Construct, Inc. and he's a builder and developer. The website noted that Morgan's then-boyfriend Brendan Fitzpatrick has been working as a real estate broker for The Agency so he does have his own money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dorothy Wang's dad, Roger Wang, has a $3.8 billion net worth and is chairman of Golden Eagle Retail Group Limited.</p><p>As for EJ Johnson, the other cast member who has become the most famous, his father is Magic Johnson, the famous basketball athlete who also started the company Magic Johnson Enterprises.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Erin Andrews Almost Changed Her Career Drastically For This Reality Show</a></span></p><h2 id=how-the-show-began>How The Show Began</h2><p>Morgan Stewart talked about the <a href=#>origin of Rich Kids of Beverly Hills</a> and shared that she was cast because she's good friends with co-star Dorothy Wang.</p><p>Morgan also said that the show is definitely authentic and that they would shoot all day long and then a discussion that is a few hours' long will be edited into a few minutes. Morgan said, according to Aol.com, "It's all real. We have a real show; I don't know what other shows are like, but we're all real friends and we all grew up in Beverly Hills. You know what I mean? Nobody is telling us what to say or do. If somebody was doing that, I'd be on a scripted show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also interesting to note that the show is based on the Tumblr account Rich Kids of Instagram, according to Dailymail.co.uk. The six main stars became very well-known on social media and that led to them being cast.</p><p>Morgan explained getting cast on the reality series: "I got involved with "Rich Kids" because Dorothy was approached by a casting director at the time, and they said, 'bring your friends, I think you guys have something special.' And so her and I did a tape and then six weeks later we had a show. I mean, I wish this story was more exciting and I've told this story so many times I don't really remember, but it was meant to be so it happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What The Cast Of 'The Hills: New Beginnings' Has Said About The Show</a></span></p><p>While some reality TV fans remember Rich Kids of Beverly Hills, it didn't get as much buzz as some others in the genre, and that might explain the cancellation after only four seasons.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Adrienne Bailon & Other Stars On Why They Regret Appearing On Reality TV Shows</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmqaKbmGK4qrDSZqafZZKaw6a%2By7JkoaGcocBus86tZJyZnpiyrbHDaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richest-soccer-player-athletes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hugo Lloris Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-why-botched-doctors-once-rejected-this-teen-mom-star.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why 'Botched' Doctors Once Rejected This 'Teen Mom' Star</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
