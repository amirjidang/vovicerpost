But Morgane is much more than just an amazing wife and mother. She has provided background and duet vocals for Chris Stapleton’s band and proved an indispensable part of his debut album Traveller and subsequent music career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Split When It Comes To Meeting This Country Music Star</a></span></p><p>And Chris isn’t the only one to benefit from Morgane’s musical prowess. Not only has she sung the background tracks for many successful country singers including Trace Adkins, Dierks Bentley, and Lee Ann Womack, she has also written fantastic music for them. Here are some of the country songs she has written for famous country kings and queens.</p><h2 id=carrie-underwood---39-don-rsquo-t-forget-to-remember-me-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Carrie Underwood - 'Don’t Forget To Remember Me'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carrie Underwood tells a story of saying goodbye to one stage of life and moving on to the next through a beautiful melody. The song was co-written with Ashley Gore and Kelley Lovelace, and Morgane (going by maiden name Hayes at the time) made sure that this song was one to remember. The song slayed the U.S. charts, landing the second spot on the country charts in 2006. It debuted on Underwood's first album Some Hearts, making a great start to what would be a legendary career for the seven-time Grammy winner Carrie Underwood.</p><h2 id=leann-rimes---39-you-ain-rsquo-t-right-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>LeAnn Rimes - 'You Ain’t Right'</span></h2><p>For her controversial but relatively successful eleventh studio album, Spitfire, LeAnn Rimes included a track written by Morgane in 2013 called "You Ain't Right". Chris provided some background vocals for the song, and this tune was ultimately one of the better reviewed ones of the album (Rimes' third country one in a row).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Lesser-Known Facts About Country Music Star, Mickey Guyton</a></span></p><h2 id=byron-hill---39-ramblings-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Byron Hill - 'Ramblings'</span></h2><p>Along with the artist himself (who later dedicated a majority of his career to writing hit songs for other country artists) and Darrell Hayes, Morgane wrote two songs for Byron Hill's solo album 2004’s Ramblings. Together, they wrote the songs, “Bad For the Heart” and “Wings of your Love” for his album. He would later go on to produce three more studio albums and write for many different country performers.</p><h2 id=kellie-pickler---39-stop-cheating-on-me-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kellie Pickler - 'Stop Cheating On Me'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A straightforward title for an equally simple message, this song was definitely one to look out for on Pickler’s 2011 album 100 Proof. Morgane co-wrote this track with husband Chris Stapleton and Liz Rose, which proved to be a winning combination. She also provided her vocals on this song, as well as a few others for this album including "Where's Tammy Wynette", "Long As I Never See You Again" and "Rockaway". This album is Kellie Pickler’s highest charting album of her career, landing on the Billboard charts at number 7 (number 2 in top country albums).</p><h2 id=alan-jackson---39-talk-is-cheap-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Alan Jackson - 'Talk Is Cheap'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another country veteran known for his songs all around, it might surprise some to know Morgane wrote for legendary Alan Jackson in 2012. She, along with husband Chris Stapleton and friend Guy Clark, wrote track number four "Talk is Cheap" for his seventeenth album Thirty Miles West. The album received much praise, and despite mixed reviews, Thirty Miles West slayed the charts at the top spot for Billboard's Top Country Albums and number two on Billboard's 200.</p><h2 id=trisha-yearwood---39-we-tried-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Trisha Yearwood - 'We Tried'</span></h2><p>The iconic trio Morgane, Chris, and Liz Rose once again put their skills to work to write for the icon Trisha Yearwood. They wrote track number six “We Tried” from Yearwood’s eleventh studio album Heaven, Heartache, and the Power of Love (which was released in 2007 by Big Machine Records). The album became critically acclaimed and gained favorable reviews, peaking at number 10 on the top country album charts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Did Danica Patrick Come To Becoming A Country Music Singer?</a></span></p><h2 id=claire-bowen-and-sam-palladio---39-casino-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Claire Bowen And Sam Palladio - 'Casino'</span></h2><p>Morgane has also delved into the TV world, writing a song for season one of the smash country hit Nashville. With Natalie Hemby, Morgane wrote the song “Casino” for the show and it appeared on The Music of Nashville, Season 1: The Complete Collection. The song was performed in season 1, episode 13 “There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight” by Claire Bowem and Sam Palladio, portraying Scarlett O’Connor and Gunnar Scott respectively. The song really showed the chemistry between the two characters in the show, making fans excited to see more when it came to the on-screen couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reba-mcentire---39-ain-rsquo-t-got-nothing-on-my-pain-39><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Reba McEntire - 'Ain’t Got Nothing On My Pain'</span></h2><p>One of their more recent works, the trio was back again to write a bonus track for Reba’s thirty-third studio album Stronger Than This. It takes a lot of skill to write for the iconic and beautiful Reba McEntire, who has featured on more than 30 studio albums and sold 75 million records worldwide. The album was eventually nominated for Best Country Album at the 62nd Grammys in 2019. The song “Ain’t Got Nothing on My Pain” proved feisty and strong, and many fans think it should have been a bigger part of the album and not just a bonus.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Which Country Legend Was 'Apprehensive' About Being Name-Dropped In A Taylor Swift Song?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur8eroKxlo6musbjEraanZaees6Z51qGgnKBdm66uu9SsZJynpaPBs8WMrKCnn5WnwG60wKxkrKCVYsSztdOtnKdlo6S7qL%2BMn6arZZOWv7O1xGasp5yVp8Swu8No</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./criss-angel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Criss Angel dating?
