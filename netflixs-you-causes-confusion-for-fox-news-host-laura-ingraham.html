His delivery is great tho <a href=#>https://t.co/8UFfy7IpZf</a></p><p>— Penn Badgley (@PennBadgley) <a href=#>November 16, 2021</a></p><p>Moments later, the <a href=#>Gossip Girl alum</a> added, “Definitely a bit. His delivery is great tho,” referring to Ingraham’s guest, <strong>Raymond Arroyo</strong>.</p><p>It turns out, Badgley was right. Arroyo, 51, confirmed on Tuesday that the interaction was planned.</p><p>“My favorite part was that only regular viewers realized it was totally scripted,” he tweeted, adding the hashtag #YousOnFirst.</p><p>The conservative commentator also thanked Badgley for complimenting his performance. “Your delivery is pretty great as well,” he <a href=#>wrote</a>. “Now please don’t #YouNetflix kill all my friends!!”</p><p>Original story 11/16/21:</p><p>Netflix’s You caused much confusion for Fox News host <strong>Laura Ingraham</strong> — and left the internet feeling as if they were stuck in a hilarious comedy routine worthy of <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>.</p><p>On Monday, November 15, The&nbsp;Ingraham Angle did a segment dedicated to TV shows that have included “woke” story lines about <a href=#>COVID-19 and vaccines</a>. The episode’s featured guest <strong>Raymond Arroyo</strong>&nbsp;mentioned the <strong>Penn Badgley</strong> series about a murderous stalker by name — and things went downhill from there.</p><p>“I was watching an episode of You when measles came up,” Arroyo said, in <a href=#>a clip</a> from Monday night’s show in which he attempted to <a href=#>reference a season 3 episode</a> in which <a href=#>Joe (Badgley)</a> and his infant son with wife Love (<a href=#><strong>Victoria Pedretti</strong></a>) get the measles after attending a party with an unvaccinated child in their neighborhood.</p><p>Ingraham, 58, immediately looked puzzled. “Wait, wait, wait,” she said, interrupting the EWTN News anchor. “When did I mention measles?”</p><p>Arroyo then seemed equally caught off guard, telling her, “I don’t know. It was on You.”</p><p>However, Ingraham didn’t understand that he was <a href=#>referring to the streaming show</a>. She thought he was referring to her. “What was on me?” she asked. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>As Arroyo tried to explain that he was referring to an episode of You, the syndicated radio host became visibly annoyed. “We never did a measles and vaccine episode,” she said. “Is this a joke?”</p><p>Though it may have felt like a comedy bit to viewers who watched Ingraham continue to question why Arroyo claimed that her show had done <a href=#>an episode about the measles</a> when it never had, it was clearly not pre-planned.</p><p>“Raymond!” she said. “I’ve never had measles. What are you talking about? This is stupid!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Netflix-You-Causes-Hilarious-Confusion-Fox-News-Host-0002.jpg><p>Arroyo once again told her that he was referring to an episode of the show You — but she still wasn’t getting it. “What’s he talking about? I’ve just never done a show on measles,” Ingraham said. “I completely give up.”</p><p>Ingraham may have been done with the topic, but the internet was just getting started with the LifeZette editor in chief’s on-air gaffe. “#SNL couldn’t do better than this,” one Twitter user wrote on Tuesday, November 16.</p><p>Another person tweeted, “To be fair, Abbott and Costello did it better decades ago,” in reference to the duo’s classic “Who’s on First?” bit.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ingraham’s not the only one who makes mistakes — even<a href=#> those who work on You</a> have make the occasional error. Last month, fans noticed that Joe’s avatar when he texts Love <a href=#>doesn’t look anything like Badgley</a>.</p><p>“IM LOSING MY MIND???? WHO IS THAT??????” the TikTok user captioned their October 21 video, before jokingly referring to the doppelgänger as “JOEY SILVERBERG.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGannaSbuarE0mawqK1dmK62v8SsZJynnpvCtLXOp2Sfp6Jis7DEjKecsKtdnby0wIylmK6qkWK2r7PRmp%2BapV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./north-west-blue-ivy-carter-and-other-celebrity-kids-who-will-rule-hollywood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>North West, Blue Ivy Carter, And Other Celebrity Kids Who Will Rule Hollywood</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nathan-parsons-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nathan Parsons Net Worth How Much is Parsons Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
