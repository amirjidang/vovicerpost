Born Jarad Anthony Higgins in Chicago, Illinois, Juice Wrld rose to fame in 2018 with his debut album Goodbye & Good Riddance and followed it up only five months later with the number two debut Wrld on Drugs, a collaborative EP recorded with Future. Late last year, <a href=#>around what would have been his 23rd birthday</a>, fans got a chance to celebrate Juice's life with the release of Juice WRLD: Into the Abyss, a documentary focusing on the life and death of the rapper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Facts About Juice WRLD That Have Recently Come To Light</a></span></p><p>Juice Wrld had only had a short career before his death, having begun releasing music just three years before passing, but his impact on both his peers and the music industry as a whole has not gone unnoticed. During his career, Juice collaborated with dozens of famous rappers and singers, releasing over 130 charting singles, the majority with other artists, including some of the biggest names in music, such as The Weeknd, Eminem, and Maroon 5. But his friendships with his musical peers have lived on in his death. Juice Wrld's estate has released two posthumous albums and multiple collaborations, keeping him at the top of the charts even in death, while many of his famous friends continue to post tributes to Juice in the two years since he passed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=halsey-got-a-tattoo-in-tribute><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Halsey Got A Tattoo In Tribute</span></h2><p>"If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power" singer Halsey had such a close relationship with the rapper that she has a tribute to him permanently marked on her skin. Halsey and Juice collaborated on several songs, including the posthumous release "Life's A Mess," the title of which Halsey has had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inked into her hand to celebrate the life of her friend</a>. Upon the release of the single, <a href=#>she took to Instagram and referred to Juice as "one of the greatest people I have ever known</a>, and one of the most brilliant artists we will ever live to witness." The two friends had previously worked on a remix of Halsey's number one single "Without Me" in 2019, while Halsey had covered Juice's song "Lucid Dreams" in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=xxxtentacion-and-juice-never-got-to-meet><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>XXXTentacion And Juice Never Got To Meet</span></h2><p>The last time that Juice and X spoke was over Facetime, where the two were planning on meeting up in real life after forming a friendship over social media and text. X was shot and killed during an attempted robbery in June 2018. The following day, Juice released the two-track Too Soon.. EP, released in remembrance of, and dedicated to, both X and rapper Lil Peep who had died the year prior. The EP artwork featured a screenshot from a conversation between the friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Juice Wrld's Net Worth Was Before He Passed Away</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellie-goulding-39-wanted-to-know-everything-39-about-the-rapper><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ellie Goulding 'Wanted To Know Everything' About The Rapper</span></h2><p>Ellie Goulding first heard Juice's song "Lucid Dreams" and was immediately intrigued. "When I’d heard Lucid Dreams for the first time, I was like, 'Who is this?,' and I don’t have that moment very often with artists," the "Love Me Like You Do" singer said. The two eventually linked up and recorded the song "Hate Me" together. “(I) was just so looking forward to having this song together that would connect me with him forever. Whenever you do a collaboration you’re connected forever," Goulding told ABC News. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I wish I’d got to spend more time with him.</a>"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ski-mask-the-slump-god-lost-juice-not-long-after-xxx><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ski Mask The Slump God Lost Juice Not Long After XXX</span></h2><p>Juice and Ski Mask The Slump God were close friends and collaborators after meeting in early 2018. The pair were constantly hyping one another up on IG live and embarked on their joint Death Race for Love Tour in 2019. The two friends were working together on a mixtape called Evil Twins before Juice's passing which is yet to be released. After the death of his friend, Ski Mask posted a series of heartbreaking tweets, writing "They can't keep taking my brothers from me," referring to both Juice and X.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Eminem Song Shatters Records And Immortalizes Juice WRLD</a></span></p><h2 id=benny-blanco-knew-how-talented-juice-was><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Benny Blanco Knew How Talented Juice Was</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Songwriter and producer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Benny Blanco discovered Juice on Instagram</a> and was blown away by his talent. "He hears one second of the beat, he goes in and not only does he come up with the lyrics and the melody, but he does the entire song in one take," Blanco recalls. "And he did three more takes and did three more hit songs over the same beat. And then he just says, 'Pick the best parts you like.'" Blanco and Juice would record eight songs in their first session together, and Blanco was amazed by the talent. "And it wasn’t like he had dumb lyrics—his s*** made you feel something.” The two remained close, recording more music just one month before his death.</p><h2 id=g-herbo-was-amazed-at-how-humble-juice-stayed><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>G Herbo Was Amazed At How Humble Juice Stayed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Longtime friend and fellow Chicago rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">G Herbo was equally enamoured by Juice</a> when he first heard him sing. "The first time I heard his music, it was just crazy," he said. "Some of the hardest shit I ever heard from a kid." G Herbo described his friend as being humble, someone who never took advantage of the power he had built up with his talent and his career. "The impact that he left on the world is crazy. Only he could do it. I’ve never seen nothing like it.
