Kids would say, ‘Ew, greasy.’ It wasn’t necessarily something that I was embracing. As soon as I turned 21 and we hit the college years on Sister, Sister, I decided to straighten my hair because that’s what everyone was doing.”</p><p>It wasn’t until her late twenties that Mowry began to think differently about her look — especially after meeting <a href=#><strong>Tracee Ellis Ross</strong></a>, who was known for rocking her natural coils on the series Girlfriends, when they worked together on a 2006 spinoff called The Game.</p><p>“When I first met Tracee, she told me how beautiful my hair was and how gorgeous my curls were,” Mowry recalled. “Her words of encouragement left a nice impact on me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tia-Mowry-Wanted-to-Change-Her-Natural-Hair-Until-Tracee-Ellis-Ross-Showed-Her-How-to-Love-It-2.jpg><p>By 2012, the natural hair movement was born, and Mowry embraced it. “I remember seeing this amazing community of diverse women with different textures of hair,” she said. “They were freeing themselves from straightening and chemicals. They were doing the big chop. They were putting their foot down, saying, ‘We define what beauty is.’ I followed this trend, and I’ve been on this amazing incredible journey since then.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, Mowry found herself struggling to find creams, shampoos and conditioners that worked. So, in January 2023, she launched <a href=#>4U by Tia</a>, a line of non-toxic haircare products for all curl types. “I felt like there was a void,” Mowry said, explaining that she tapped a range of experts, influencers and everyday people to help her brainstorm diverse hair needs through a four-day workshop. The result was an assortment of sulfate and silicone-free items that are good for the environment and come with an affordable price tag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tia-Mowry-Wanted-to-Change-Her-Natural-Hair-Until-Tracee-Ellis-Ross-Showed-Her-How-to-Love-It-3.jpg><p>For Mowry, it’s not just about slapping her name on the bottles. She uses the line daily on herself and her children — son Cree, 12, and daughter Cairo, 5, whom she shares with <a href=#>ex-husband</a> <strong>Cory Hardrict</strong>. And she makes sure to preach as well as practice.</p><p>“I am constantly affirming my children,” she said. “I was just telling Cree how awesome and beautiful his hair is, and the same goes for Cairo. I always say, ‘Why are you so cute? Why are you so beautiful?’ I just think it’s really important for them to hear those things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX528uHnTophmpZ%2Bsv7q%2FjKeYra2ilrlutMCiqWain6q%2Fr7HYZp%2BepKCasW6%2F05qprWWYmr9urtSsoKedo6h8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-open-eau-thermale-avene.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to open eau thermale avene</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-to-tip-for-pedicure.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much to Tip for Pedicure Tipping Guide 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
