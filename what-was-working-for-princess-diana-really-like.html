Somehow, she was never one of "them". She had the common touch, an ability to connect with people. Some say it was compensation for a largely lonely childhood followed by a loveless marriage to Prince Charles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Diana</a>&nbsp;was complicated is a vast understatement. She was not "smart" in an intellectual sense but seemed to have a genius for creating the myth that was the People's Princess. If she liked you or thought you were useful in building her brand, she was the heart and soul of generosity. But if she didn't like you, she was capable of inflicting deep and lasting hurt.</p><p>What was it like to work for her? Well, if she liked you, it was great. Wonderful. If she didn't like or trust you, she could turn unbelievably nasty.</p><p>She was both a breath of fresh air and an insidious threat to the monarchy. And when she died in a car crash in Paris in 1997, Britain went into a state of hysterical mourning that the Royals struggled to understand.</p><p>Here's what it was really like to work for Princess Di.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=call-me-diana-refreshingly-informal><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Call Me Diana: Refreshingly Informal</span></h2><p>Her lack of airs and graces annoyed some in the Royal family. Her then-husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Charles</a> complained that when they did engagements together, she stole the show. She had an open and friendly way of meeting and greeting people, whether they were a Hollywood star, a Duchess, or an AIDS patient. The public loved her. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Royal family</a>? Not so much. The staff, for the most part, appreciated her informality.</p><h2 id=could-be-a-fun-boss-sense-of-humor-and-prankster><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Could Be A Fun Boss: Sense Of Humor And Prankster</span></h2><p>She laughed long and hard if she were happy or she had managed to pull off one of her practical jokes. Her sister once pranked her by putting a "toy" into her handbag just before a foreign tour. She opened the bag and roared with laughter, insisting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Le Gadget"</a> be put in her bag for all foreign junkets. Oh, and she liked dirty jokes too.</p><h2 id=good-lines-of-communication-to-staff><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Good Lines Of Communication To Staff</span></h2><p>One thing her staff knew they could depend on was being kept informed of her plans and intentions. This was particularly important with her security detail. After she and Charles separated in 1992, this was totally crucial as she undertook marathon charitable projects and trips on her own that saw her in minefields in war zones and the like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-the-sharpest-tool-in-the-shed><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Not The Sharpest Tool In The Shed</span></h2><p>As a small child, she was homeschooled and then, in true British aristocratic fashion, was sent away to school. She was not&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">academically bright</a>, preferring creative, athletic, and artistic pursuits. By the late 1970s, she was in London working as a nanny and a kindergarten teacher. She was not an intellectually gifted boss but had strong "instincts" that served her well for a time.</p><h2 id=but-genius-at-branding-marketing-the-myth-and-the-reality><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>But Genius At Branding/Marketing: The Myth And The Reality</span></h2><p>Married in 1981, separated in 1992, and divorced in 1996, Diana was a genius at branding and marketing herself as a "wronged" woman who was the victim of a cold Royal family. She also "promoted" her image as an international doer of good, getting involved with issues related to AIDS and cancer. Staff was expected to put out the right message at the right time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=get-the-vibe-she-was-the-first-real-housewife><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Get The Vibe: She Was The First Real Housewife</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Post</a>&nbsp;called her the very first "Real Housewife" because of her ability to script and publicly promote the story she wanted to put out there. Staff had to be consistent in its presentation of the angle she was pursuing at any given moment. There were so many: The loving mother, the wronged wife, the breath of fresh air, the Mother Theresa of Princesses.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Housewives: Our Favorite Housewives Ranked From Annoying To Lovable</a></span></p><h2 id=it-was-an-emotional-roller-coaster-ride><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>It Was An Emotional Roller-Coaster Ride</span></h2><p>The picture is from a 1995 TV interview Diana gave. She was the wronged wife who only wanted to be a "Princess in People's Hearts". She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted to bulimia, suicide attempts, </a>and a marriage that was a failure. Emotionally, she could be all over the place. Even when she was pregnant with William in the early 1980s, she reportedly intentionally threw herself down a flight of stairs. Staff had to be prepared for extreme behavior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=if-she-liked-you-you-got-visits-and-sharing><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>If She Liked You, You Got Visits And Sharing</span></h2><p>Diana's go-to confidante and her unofficial chief advisor was her butler Paul Burrell. She also liked and gossiped with her chef Darren McGrady. After her separation from Charles in 1992, her staff was really and truly "hers", whereas before Charles had the upper hand in choosing her staff. She treated them well, remembering birthdays and special occasions. One of her security men, Ken Wharfe, called her a fun boss.</p><h2 id=if-she-disliked-you-watch-out><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>If She Disliked You, Watch Out</span></h2><p>No one felt Diana's wrath more than Tiggy Legge-Bourke, the nanny hired by Charles. Tiggy was a down to earth and fun person Princes William and Harry adored. A jealous Diana even loudly and publicly accused Tiggy of having an affair with Charles and of aborting his baby. Also on her "hate" list, her stepmother Raine Spencer. She referred to her as "Acid Raine". The message to staff: Don't get on Diana's wrong side.</p><h2 id=john-travolta-and-cindy-crawford-dropped-by><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>John Travolta And Cindy Crawford Dropped By</span></h2><p>Diana loved A-listers and A-listers loved her. She danced with John Travolta, was frenemies with Elton John, hung out with Liza Minnelli, and stayed with Goldie Hawn at her ranch. Cindy Crawford was also a chum. The staff got used to it. And, Diana's ever-present security staff, enjoyed their frequent celebrity encounters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Travolta Probably Wishes These Rumors Would Quietly Go Away</a></span></p><h2 id=needed-to-learn-where-the-real-power-lay><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Needed To Learn Where The Real Power Lay</span></h2><p>For years, Patrick Jephson was Diana's "official" chief of staff. But everyone knew (or should have known) that her butler Paul Burrell was her closest friend and confidante. Jephson's complaints fell on Diana's deaf ears. If you wanted an "in" with Diana, the staff knew to beat a path to Burrell's door. He was in the car with her when she died. He survived.</p><h2 id=don-t-mention-camilla-parker-bowles><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Don't Mention Camilla Parker-Bowles</span></h2><p>Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles went way back and were very friendly. Very. The only thing was she married Andrew Parker-Bowles. Charles and Camilla seemed to have carried on with their lust-fest, even after Charles married Diana. In 1989, a petulant Diana confronted Camilla, who in her typically cool fashion, waved her away. Staff knew Camilla was "the hated one". Diana called her "The Rottweiler".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-needed-to-turn-a-blind-eye-to-the-affairs><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>You Needed To Turn A Blind Eye To The Affairs</span></h2><p>Even in the 1980s, Diana was having affairs. There was her bodyguard Barry Mannakee. Then in 1986 came Major James Hewitt. There was even a car salesman by the&nbsp;name of James Gilbey that took her fancy for a time. But the man she called "the love of her life" was a surgeon by the name of Hasnat Khan. Prior to the divorce, the staff had to learn to be discreet and get very accomplished with cover stories.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We Still Have Questions About Princess Diana's Other Man</a></span></p><h2 id=you-had-to-get-used-to-noisy-kids-during-school-holidays><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>You Had To Get Used To Noisy Kids During School Holidays</span></h2><p>Prince Charles is said to have commented that Diana was an excellent mother, especially when the cameras were clicking. From the very beginning of their lives, she set out to give William and Harry a taste of real life, whether that be Disneyland or feeding the homeless. The sense of giving she instilled in them is probably her strongest legacy. Staff was expected to put up with the noise and their schoolboy antics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-a-gossip-you-won-t-believe-what-i-just-heard><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Was A Gossip: You Won't Believe What I Just Heard</span></h2><p>Diana did not treat the Royal family with much respect. They returned the insult. She eagerly pushed her way into chef Darren McGrady's kitchen to breathlessly tell him of deep dark secrets she had just heard from the Queen. They laughed at Charles' slavish devotion to Camilla, down to wanting to be one of her sanitary products. Think about that time of the month. Staff heard the latest gossip, whether they wanted to or not.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Diana's Relationship With Harry And William.
