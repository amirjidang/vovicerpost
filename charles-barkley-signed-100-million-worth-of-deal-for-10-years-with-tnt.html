His current contract coincides with TNT’s agreement with the NBA deal expiring after the 2024-25 season. If Turner were not to keep the NBA, Barkley could potentially own rights to go work for another network or a digital platform, if Amazon or Apple or others are involved, per <a href=#><i>New York Post.</i></a></p><p>The exact amount Barkley will make is not yet known if he fulfills the entire contract, but it will be well in excess of $100 million and could approach $200 million. Barkley could decide to retire from TV before the deal ends.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Former NBA Star Ben Gordon Allegedly Hit 10-Year-Old Son Arrested In LaGuardia Airport</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barkley, 59, has repeatedly spoken about retiring at 60, but TNT has made a huge commitment to him and his partners. While Shaquille O’Neal already has a long-term agreement, TNT has also re-signed host Ernie Johnson and analyst Kenny Smith to new deals. Turner officially announced all the deals later on Monday.</p><p>“We’re all a big family – Ernie, Kenny and Shaquille are brothers to me – and I wouldn’t still be here if it wasn’t for them and all the amazing people who work on our show,” Barkley said. “I’m not gonna lie, though, this is a life-altering deal…and I’m blessed to be able to do live television for a living.”</p><p>Ernie Johnson added, “I always say there are ‘Got to, jobs’ and Get to, jobs,’ and the four of us clearly have ‘Get to, jobs’,” said Johnson. “It’s been a journey of a lifetime to work on this show, with Charles, Kenny and Shaquille at the desk and alongside such an amazingly talented crew behind the scenes. I’m very blessed.”</p><p>“I’ve been on a few championship teams in my day, but there’s nothing quite like this one,” said Smith. “I wanted to continue doing the show because of the basketball and cultural impact that our show has become. I’m excited for the season and many more to come.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barkley is arguably the greatest sports studio analyst of all time and the landscape for what sportscasters are paid has changed dramatically in recent years, led by the NFL.</p><p>Tom Brady has a contract with Fox to be a game analyst that, The Post previously reported, will pay him $375 million over 10 years when it begins. That comes on the heels of Tony Romo and Troy Aikman making in the neighborhood of $18 million a year as NFL game analysts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Warner Bros. Discovery, TNT’s corporate parent, Barkley will add to his portfolio by producing documentaries and other projects with his production company, Round Mound Media, according to sources.</p><p>This summer, LIV Golf’s Greg Norman met with Barkley about joining that tour as a commentator. Barkley spoke openly about being interested in seeing what LIV might offer and spoke out about “selective outrage” regarding LIV, believing there was precedent to accept money from the Saudi-backed upstart association. Before LIV made an offer, Barkley pulled out of negotiations. At that point, Turner had not started talks with Barkley, but sources indicated to The Post that they would.</p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Complex</i></a>, Earlier this year, while discussing his media opportunities, which included a deal with LIV golf, said on the <i>Pat McAfee Show.</i></p><p>“I don’t judge other people. Listen, if someone gave me $200 million, I’d kill a relative. … I’m serious. They said Phil Mickelson got $200 million and Dustin Johnson got $150 million. For $150 million, I’d kill a relative, even one I liked!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>George Floyd's Family Allegedly Sued Kanye West For Claiming Floyd Died Of Fentanyl</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Complex</a>, <a href=#>New York Post</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwqa3RpZysZZKWv6y4xLJkrKGXo7KleZBpZ2almaG5qrvNZq6oqqSderCyjJ2cmqRdm7yzeZBpZLKdkafAbsPIrZ9mrJ6pfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christina-haack-tarek-el-moussa-celebrate-daughters-12th-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christina Haack, Tarek El Moussa Celebrate Daughter's 12th Birthday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./channing-tatum-other-celebrities-who-use-dating-apps.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Channing Tatum &amp;amp; Other Celebrities Who Use Dating Apps</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
