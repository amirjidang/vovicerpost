An unknown tomb was identified using electronic surveys that showed gaps beneath the church’s surface.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>SANTA'S THAT MADE BANK</a></strong></p><p>St. Nicholas, or Father Christmas, used all his inheritance in helping the needy, the suffering, and the sick. He is&nbsp;what the&nbsp;<a href=#>Santa Claus</a>&nbsp;legend was built on. St. Nicholas became the famous Santa Claus in the 1930s because of Coca Cola’s famous Christmas campaign that created the red suit wearing old fellow with a snow-white beard and an undying laughter.</p><p>Via: cultofweird.com</p><p>There have been many stories about his kind deeds. One of tales&nbsp;describes how a bag of gold mysteriously appeared in a man’s house who was collecting money to get his daughters married. If he didn’t have the gold, his daughters were going to be sold as slaves. This legend marked the beginning of people leaving stockings hanging on fireplaces so that Santa Claus can come and leave gifts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT SANTA CLAUS</a></strong></p><p>Another legend says that once St. Nicholas prayed and saved a ship from being wrecked by a violent sea. And that is why St. Nicholas is also known as the patron saint of voyagers.</p><p>Historians believe St. Nicholas was born in the ancient Greek city of Myra, today known as Demre. Cemil Karabayram, head of Antalya’s Monument Authority, hopes to find an untouched body of St. Nicholas beneath the church’s floor. Karabayram said it is just the beginning, and a lot still needs to be discovered to get a better picture of the reality.</p><p>It is thought that St. Nicholas died in 343 AD and was buried under the church in 1087. His body was kept in Bari, Italy before taking it to Demre. Recently, bones were found near the church but it was later revealed that&nbsp;they didn’t belong to St. Nicholas. Instead, they were actually the bones of&nbsp;a local priest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>CRAZY SANTA LEGENDS</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3y0u8yepqedXZu8trrDZqqapqSWwG6z0Zqtnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-worst-head-coaches-in-nfl-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Worst Head Coaches In NFL History</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./urban-outfitters-corset-bustier-lookalike-top-amazon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shop This Viral Lace Bustier Corset on Sale for 57% Off!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
