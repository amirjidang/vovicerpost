And they called the cops and said it was me. This is like, a true story. I heard this from actually Stassi during an interview. It was just funny, because they thought it was me because it was a black woman with a weave. So they just assumed it would be me, and they called the cops on me.”</p><p>Schroeder first recounted this story in a since-deleted episode of the “Bitch Bible” podcast in 2018. Shortly after Stowers’ allegations came to light, she <a href=#>lost endorsements</a> and addressed her past mistakes in a candid Instagram post.</p><p>“It is important <a href=#>that I continue to take accountability for what I have said and done</a>, while pushing myself to do better. I have grown significantly from the person I was then, and I am still filled with remorse and regret for the hurt I caused,” the Next Level Basic author wrote on Sunday, June 7. “I am grateful for the people in my life that continue to check me and push me to evolve into a more educated person.”</p><p>The “Straight Up With Stassi” host later admitted that there was “no excuse” for the way she and Doute treated Stowers. “I did not recognize then the serious ramifications that could have transpired because of my actions. What I did to Faith was wrong. I apologize and I do not expect forgiveness,” she wrote.</p><p>Doute, for her part, told her fans that she was “taking some time to really process what I’ve been seeing, feeling and learning” while <a href=#>Black Lives Matter protests</a> continue to spark difficult conversations around the country.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Although my actions were not racially driven, I am now completely aware of <a href=#>how my privilege blinded me</a> from the reality of law enforcement’s treatment of the black community, and how dangerous my actions could have been to [Faith],” she wrote on Sunday, addressing her former costar’s accusations via Instagram. “It was never my intention to add to the injustice and imbalance. I’m ashamed, embarrassed, and incredibly sorry. I will do better. I have to do better.”</p><p>After reaching out for comment from Schroeder about not speaking to Faith before she posted her apology, Us learned that she was dropped by her PR company.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJGowKp5yqugrKyVo3qltcOnq2aroJqurHnWoquhZZaWtrW0jKyrqK%2BVp8BursSfpqudXaXCo7jInGSaqJ%2BhvKjFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tech-nine-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tech Nine Net Worth How Much is Nine Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sanrio-x-converse-to-release-hello-kitty-sneakers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sanrio xConverseto Release Hello Kitty Sneakers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
