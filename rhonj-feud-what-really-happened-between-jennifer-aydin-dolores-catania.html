While the two had been besties months before, fans are confused over what exactly happened between the two and just why they aren't speaking anymore.</p><h2 id=the-39-rhonj-39-trio-might-be-done-for-good>The 'RHONJ' Trio Might Be Done For Good</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey cast has undergone quite a few changes since its debut back in 2009.</p><p>While Teresa Giudice remains the only original standing housewife on the series and one of the last few of the entire Bravo franchise, the show has kept the same cast for 5 seasons now.</p><p>When Dolores Catania and Jennifer Aydin joined the cast years back, a new RHONJ group was formed with Teresa Giudice, and fans immediately became obsessed with the iconic trio.</p><p>Dolo, Jen, and Tre — as fans refer to them, always had each other's backs, proving that they were a trio not to be reckoned with. Well, it seems as if the three musketeers are no more after Dolores and Jennifer had a falling out post-season 12 filming.</p><p>The two came head to head at the reunion, shocking fans who adored the two's friendship. So, what went wrong? We still don't really know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Heartwarming Moment Turns Sour On The 'RHONJ' Season 12 Finale</a></span></p><h2 id=dolores-and-jennifer-are-now-at-odds>Dolores And Jennifer Are Now At Odds</h2><p>During the first part of the season 12 reunion, Dolores and Jennifer went at it, revealing to Andy Cohen and viewers that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two are no longer friendly.</a></p><p>While the details are fuzzy, considering the two apparently began their feud off-camera, it seems as if it all began after Jennifer felt Dolores didn't have her back this season. It all came down to Dolores telling Jennifer not to cry after Margaret Joseph's brought Jennifer and Bill's marital scruple to the surface.</p><p>Jennifer felt as if Dolores didn't support her at that moment, which snowballed into the two no longer being on speaking terms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'I'm so tired of your backhanded compliments," Jennifer told Dolores during the reunion.

Dolores went as far as to claim that she will never be friends with Jennifer Aydin again and repeatedly called her "disgusting," while filming the reunion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether it's about loyalty or something fans aren't aware of just yet, it's safe to say that viewers are quite sad and confused over Jen and Dolo's fallout, considering how close the two had been before.</p><h2 id=teresa-giudice-amp-dolores-catania-are-still-friends>Teresa Giudice & Dolores Catania Are Still Friends</h2><p>In addition to Dolores being at odds with Jennifer, rumors began swirling that Dolores and Teresa were also not on the best of terms. It was revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teresa did not invite Dolores to her engagement party</a>, which left many fans stunned.</p><p>“I would be lying to say it didn’t [hurt] on some level,” Dolores exclusively told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. “Not being invited somewhere shouldn’t hurt me, OK? So I’m going to remind myself of that when these things happen. I am human, but I shake it off, and I’m, like, OK," the RHONJ star said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teresa explained herself at the reunion, sharing that they had invited couples they are close to only, and considering Dolores had just broken up with her ex, David at the time, she wasn't included.</p><p>Catania understood Tre's reasoning and made it clear that there is no bad blood between the two. Both Teresa and Dolores have been friends for well over 20 years, so fans were happy to hear that they are still on good terms and remain friendly to this day.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Happened To 'RHONJ' Siggy Flicker's Face?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaeen3qnsdSdZLCgkal6s7HApaOyZZiWvbGxzZ6bZpqVqcSmsc1moZ6mnp6zpr6MmrCdoZ5isbC4zqucrGWTlsGiusiaZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shonee-fairfax-and-pro-skater-husband-benny-fairfax-are-separated-563217-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shonee Fairfax and Pro Skater Husband Benny Fairfax Are Separated</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./revenges-ashley-madekwe-shares-her-wardrobe-staples.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Revenges Ashley Madekwe Shares Her Wardrobe Staples</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
