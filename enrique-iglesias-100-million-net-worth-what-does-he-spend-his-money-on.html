Then, you’ve also got the amazing <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, who has had 70 Grammy nominations and 24 wins so far and has <a href=#>helped put other stars on the map</a>. Meanwhile, in the world of Latin pop, you’ve got Enrique Iglesias, who is also a Grammy star with four nominations and one win to date.</p><p>Iglesias is the son of legendary singer, Julio Iglesias, so we know that music runs in his blood. Over the years, he’s become known for songs such as Bailando, Hero, Experiencia Religiosa, and many more. His musical talents helped him build an estimated fortune of $100 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pitbull-8.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Pitbull Amassed His Massive $100 Million Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Pitbull's unique mix of hip-hop and Latin sounds have earned him an incredible amount of money, making for a large net worth.</span><p>With all the money that Enrique Iglesias has, he also knows how to spend it and the things that Iglesias' money has purchased are extravagant.</p><p><strong>Updated November 2023:</strong> Enrique Iglesias may have been a son of music royalty but he did not use his name to get a foot in the door. He let his talent speak for himself. Talent which has done just that and landed Iglesias with a net worth of $100 million, a figure that will only continue to grow. This is because Iglesias is currently on tour with Ricky Martin and Pitbull. The venues are sold out and that means great profits are split three ways. Great news for Iglesias so that he can continue to shop any way he wants to and not have any regrets from it.</p><h2 id=enrique-iglesias-once-owned-a-stunning-sunset-island-home><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Enrique Iglesias Once Owned A Stunning Sunset Island Home</span></h2><h3 id=purchase-price-for-the-home-7-85-million>Purchase Price For The Home: $7.85 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar50806874-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>House went on the market in 2015 for $25 million.
