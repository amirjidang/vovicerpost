While many called her a poser at the time, her career immediately took off with young girls taking up skateboarding, emulating her style, and buying her albums in droves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her career remained successful even through present-day and very public relationships with the lead singer of Sum 41 Deryck Whibley and Nickelback vocalist Chad Kroeger. Fans thought that Lavigne had met her match when she got together with Mod Sun, and he seemingly felt the same way, admitting multiple times how in love he was with Lavigne and how he felt he had met his soul mate.</p><p>Mod Sun already had his own credit in the scene that is comparable to Avril's thanks to his time playing in post-hardcore bands and appearing on the Warped Tour circuit. Fans may not be aware that Mod Sun has been working in the music industry long before his relationship with Avril as a writer, drummer, rapper, and producer, and he has worked with some pretty influential people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mod-sun-and-avril-lavigne-had-a-very-public-split>Mod Sun And Avril Lavigne Had A Very Public Split</h2><p>Mod Sun and Avril Lavigne were seen as punk rock royalty throughout their relationship. The pair got together in 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">after being introduced by their mutual friend</a> Machine Gun Kelly. Lavigne was in between relationships following two failed marriages to Deryck Whibley and Chad Kroeger.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Chad Kroeger And Avril Lavigne's Marriage And Divorce</a></span></p><p>The two worked on the song Flames off of Mod Sun's album Internet Killed the Rockstar and immediately clicked with one another. Their romance and musical relationship blossomed, with Mod Sun co-writing and producing Avril's Love Sux album.</p><p>By the spring of 2022, <a href=#>Mod Sun and Avril Lavigne were engaged</a> to each other after a proposal in Paris. They ultimately ended up calling it quits less than a year after the engagement went public. The exact reason for the split has not been announced by either party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar51219201.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mod Sun addressed the split by saying "In 1 week my entire life completely changed...I just know there's a plan for it all. I'll keep my head up + always listen to my heart, even when it feels broken."</p><p>He thanks his friends for being there for him through his time of need as well as the fans that have been attending his tour following the split. Shortly following the break-up, <a href=#>Avril Lavigne was seen hanging out with rapper Tyga</a> and eventually, the two went public with their very surprising relationship.</p><h2 id=mod-sun-has-been-in-the-industry-since-the-early-2000s>Mod Sun Has Been In The Industry Since The Early 2000s</h2><p>Mod Sun was born Derek Smith and took his stage name in 2004, which means Movement on Dreams Stand Under None. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got his start in the industry as a drummer</a> in the post-hardcore scene for a hand called Four Letter Lie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Avril Lavigne And Kelly Clarkson Have This Unlikely Musical Connection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He left Four Letter Lie in 2009 to become the drummer for the popular post-hardcore band Scary Kids Scaring Kids. This also allowed the artist to open for his own band and show off his rapping skills as Mod Sun.</p><p>When Scary Kids Scaring Kids split in 2010, Mod Sun focused his energy on rapping and was finally able to debut his first hip-hop EP that same year, with two others dropping in 2011 and 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-deep-end-scary-kids-scaring-kids-live-warped-tour-toronto-july-10-2009-hd-0-50-screenshot.png><p>Mod Sun was finally signed to Rostrum Records in 2014 as his career continued to blossom.

The release of his debut album Look Up in 2015 allowed him to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">work with many popular artists</a> of the time like Travis Barker and G-Eazy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Mod Sun’s Song ‘Flames’ About Tana Mongeau?</a></span></p><p>He also went on to develop a <a href=#>close friendship with Machine Gun Kelly</a>, who also appeared on his debut album and Downfalls High, a film they both co-directed. Mod Sun and MGK have also co-directed the film Good Mourning With A U.</p><p>This second film allowed him to also work with the lives of singers Dove Cameron and Becky G, as well as MGK's partner at the time Megan Fox.</p><p>While Mod Sun may have been making headlines for his whirlwind relationship with Avril Lavigne, the talented musician and producer has been a part of the industry for quite a long time and shows no signs of slowing down, having released God Save the Teen and subsequently gone on tour to promote the album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar51533478.jpg><p>The rapper and drummer has been keeping busy since the split from Avril Lavigne and is gearing up for the European leg of his God Save the Teen tour, with stops planned in the Netherlands, the UK, Italy, and France starting in summer 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecyom2arpaN6o7HFqKmeZZGrv6q4jKWYr6GXo7Jw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./luke-halpin-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Luke Halpin Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./liv-tyler-gives-birth-pal-kate-hudson-sends-her-congratulations-2015132.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Liv Tyler Gives Birth: Pal Kate Hudson Sends Her Congratulations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
