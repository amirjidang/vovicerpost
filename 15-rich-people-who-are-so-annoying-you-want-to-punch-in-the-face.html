From 'musicians' such as <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, to children of politicians who look like they just came off the set of The Purge, there's an endless supply of rich idiots we'd all like to punch in the face.</p><p>Fortunately, there are some exceptions to the rule. Take for example, <a href=#>Gordon Ramsay</a> and his children. In a recent article, he stated that while he flies business class with his wife, their children fly coach because they need to learn how to&nbsp;struggle like he did&nbsp;before they can&nbsp;enjoy the spoils&nbsp;and perks of hard work and success.&nbsp;It's a&nbsp;refreshing story that's overshadowed by&nbsp;the many people with the wrong mentality and who are raising their kids the wrong way, letting them do whatever they want and basically act like spoiled brats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With so many annoying rich kids/teenagers/adults-who-rely-on-parents out there, it's difficult to narrow this list to just&nbsp;15, but&nbsp;let's have a look at the&nbsp;cream of the crop&nbsp;and pick the kids we'd most love to punch in the face, not&nbsp;just once, but multiple times, over and over, until they&nbsp;would just go away for good.</p><h2 id=param-sharma---most-annoying-kid-ever><strong>Param Sharma - Most Annoying Kid Ever</strong></h2><p>And the winner for most annoying spoiled rich kid who we'd all love to punch in the face goes to Param Sharma. This loser spends most of his free time, which is all the time, posting pictures of himself with his only friend, money. Somehow this douche has over 400,000 followers on Instagram.</p><p>Param is "better known as 19-year-old Instagrammer Lavish P." He is known for his outrageous social media posts like when he threw $4,000 in the air "in an attempt to mock those who donate their money or when he called the Kardashian family 'peasants.'" We'll give him props for the Kardashian diss, but that's all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, he was jailed for selling a stolen iPhone on Craigslist. "He was sentenced to 90 days in a California prison, but controversy ensued when his attorney, Andrew Shalaby, said he was placed in a psychiatric ward instead of a regular jail cell." He may have a point.</p><h2 id=justin-dior-combs><strong>Justin Dior Combs</strong></h2><p>First of all, his middle name is 'Dior,' a very punch-worthy offense, but not his fault. On the other hand, his father, <a href=#>Sean Combs</a>, has gone by the names Puff Daddy, P.Diddy, Puffy, and Diddy. All these monikers/names are extremely worthy of multiple punches to the face. It's hard to come up with lamer names than those.</p><p>Anyways, his son, Dior Diddy, or whatever you want to call him, enjoys all the spoils of being the offspring of someone with talent -- if you want to call it that. On his sixteenth birthday, his father got him a $360,000 silver Maybach. His party was attended by members of the Jersey Shore -- who should all be on this list too. Justin also posts tons of pics of himself on the internet, all dressed up in the latest expensive threads, so he's right up there with the other rich kids deserving of a punch to the face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sheikh-hamdan-bin-mohammed-bin-rashid-al-maktoum><strong>Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum</strong></h2><p>The name alone deserves a punch to the face. The 29-year-old Prince of Dubai is the son of <a href=#>Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum</a>, the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates. This spoiled brat makes a living by spending money. To clarify, he doesn't make a living at all -- he just spends his daddy's cash, which he's extremely good at.</p><p>For example, he drives a diamond-studded, mink-finished Mercedes that's worth an estimated $4.8 million and owns the world's largest yacht, which is worth an estimated $300 million.</p><p>He basically travels the world, eats at the most expensive restaurants and spends all of his time on a permanent vacation without a care in the world -- all for doing nothing but being the son of one the wealthiest men in the world. Somebody, please punch him in the face.</p><h2 id=haji-abdul-asim><strong>Haji Abdul Asim</strong></h2><p>The Prince of Brunei is no stranger to showing off his wealth. In fact, he's probably the best in the world at doing so. For his 30th birthday, Abdul invited many Hollywood A-listers, including <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a> and <a href=#>Marisa Tomei</a> to his massive celebration at the Dorchester Hotel in London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Big parties have always been his specialty. For example, "In 2009, the billionaire playboy reportedly threw the 'Party of the Year,' spending over 70,000 euros on the flowers alone," according to Yahoo.</p><p>Not only do his parties cost a fortune, the guests can always count on expensive party favors, "including iPods, diamond jewelry, and luxury Crème de la Mer face creams."</p><p>And if you're really tight with the Brunei Prince and happen to be a hot female celebrity, you may be gifted $6 million worth of jewels, like he gave to his long-time friend <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> in 1996.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></h2><p>Where do we begin with this moron? Okay, to be honest, he did make his money on his own through the ability to sing, so we'll give him that, whether you like it or not. Other than that, however, there's no other&nbsp;reason to like or respect&nbsp;this arrogant, little prick. Even though he's not one of those rich Instagram kids, there's plenty to not like about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spitting on fans, disrespecting people regularly, trying to act hard, getting into fights when he has bodyguards protecting him, $750 haircuts, being friends with the Kardashians -- the list&nbsp;goes on and on. And saying "I feel like the <a href=#>Kurt Cobain</a> of my generation, but people just don't understand me" shows how out of touch he really&nbsp;is. That's reason enough to want to punch <a href=#>Bieber</a> in the face, repeatedly.</p><h2 id=kardashians><strong>Kardashians</strong></h2><p>Yes, all of them. Maybe with the possible&nbsp;exception of <a href=#>Kendall</a>, who works hard, seems to have done the least cosmetic work, and seems to be the most grounded and least fake. Keywords are 'possible' and 'seems.' She is a Kardashian/Jenner after all.&nbsp; We all know about <a href=#>Kim</a>, <a href=#>Khloe</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Kourtney</a>, so&nbsp;no need to elaborate. All are intolerable and very punchable.</p><p>As for <a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a>, he has zero talent and no personality whatsoever. He lives in a mansion paid for by his parents and spends all of his time moping around, depressed and wondering why nobody likes him. The reasons are obvious as we've just stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And the&nbsp;runt of the litter, <a href=#>Kylie</a>, was born as the ugly duckling of the family, but with her family fortune, she was able to transform into a slutty Barbie doll who spends all of her time taking selfies for a living.&nbsp;Just like her loser brother, she has absolutely no talent and&nbsp;is as fake as a plastic Christmas tree.&nbsp;They should all be lined up and smacked, along with their annoying boyfriends and entourage.</p><h2 id=petra-and-tamara-ecclestone><strong>Petra and Tamara Ecclestone</strong></h2><p>The 23 and 28-year-old&nbsp;daughters of Formula One racing guru, <a href=#>Bernie Ecclestone</a> have no problem going through daddy's $4.8-billion fortune. They constantly post pictures of themselves on the internet&nbsp;buying everything and anything they can get their spoiled, greedy hands on.</p><p><a href=#>Petra</a> bought an $85-million estate in Los Angeles last year, so&nbsp;Bernie may be regretting allowing his daughters to have&nbsp;access to his fortune as they have done nothing to contribute to society other than looking gorgeous. As for the house his daughter bought, he&nbsp;said, "The idea was that they'd buy super-quality property, property that would be long-term, for their kids and everything else. Didn't happen. They haven't done that. So they've had access to money which they've spent." It's not going to get any better, Bernie. Time for plan B: punch them in the face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Miley</a> is a combination of both types of rich kids on this list. She was born to a rich family, mainly from her dad's success as a musician,&nbsp;but she also has her own music career, so she does have some talent and has earned her own money -- although it was&nbsp;with the help of her dad's contacts.</p><p>Another thing she has in common with the others on this list is that she is a&nbsp;highly irritating, attention-seeking moron. From dressing and acting like a total slut, to pole dancing at the Kids Choice Awards, to twerking with any person or object she can find, Miley is a mess. And being voted number one on Maxim's Top 100 is another reason why Maxim and Miley deserve to be punched. What a disgrace.</p><h2 id=brandon-davis><strong>Brandon Davis</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Brandon</a> is the grandson of&nbsp;oil tycoon <a href=#>Marvin Davis</a>. The oil&nbsp;heir&nbsp;is close friends with&nbsp;<a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;is&nbsp;often&nbsp;making headlines&nbsp;"for drug charges infractions, alleged nightclub brawls, and crude, often inappropriate humor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He&nbsp;used to&nbsp;date actress <a href=#>Mischa Barton</a>&nbsp;and then&nbsp;called her a&nbsp;"heifer" on Twitter when they broke up, and he&nbsp;was caught on tape shortly after calling <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> "a fire crotch." Seems like a really nice guy. Talk about being a rich, spoiled brat. He's the poster child.</p><p>However, in 2011,&nbsp;he did&nbsp;broker "what many consider to be one of the largest real estate deals in Hollywood history," when he sold&nbsp;the $85-million mansion&nbsp;we previously mentioned&nbsp;to Berni Ecclestone's daughter, Petra. Birds of a feather, flocking together.</p><h2 id=vorayuth-yoovidhya><b>Vorayuth</b><strong>&nbsp;</strong><b>Yoovidhya</b></h2><p>The grandson of Red Bull founder <a href=#>Chaleo Yoovidhya</a> is part of the <a href=#>Yoovidhya family</a>&nbsp;who were ranked by Forbes magazine as the fourth richest family in Thailand, worth an&nbsp;estimated $5.4 billion. It must be nice being born into that kind of cash. However, Vorayuth "is known for milking his family's deep pockets for all they are worth." And this is exactly why he's on the list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's&nbsp;not about being&nbsp;jealous of the wealth of many of&nbsp;these characters; it's more about&nbsp;their behavior and attitude that is the problem. Whether it's flaunting wealth, or behaving like a complete jackass, there is a reason we want to punch them in the face. Case in point, when Vorayuth Yoovidhya was accused in "the hit-and-run death of a police officer and had his father pay the officer's family $97,000 to stall the civil lawsuit." What a douche.</p><h2 id=hiltons><strong>Hiltons</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Barron Hilton</a>&nbsp;joins his famous sisters Paris and <a href=#>Nicky</a>&nbsp;in annoying us with their spoiled, rich-kid behavior. The heirs to the Hilton hotel fortune have gained fame&nbsp;because of their parents' wealth, going clubbing, and nothing else.</p><p>While Paris&nbsp;has been bothering us for many years now with her reality television shows, spending millions on houses, vacations, and shopping, her brother joined in with his Instagram posts. While Barron manages to stay out of the public eye, he&nbsp;is part of the rich kids on Instagram and has a following of close to 200,000 -- nowhere near his sister's 4.7 million viewers, but she had a lengthy&nbsp;head start and&nbsp;dresses like a wh--e.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barron did manage to make the headlines in 2011 when "he was fined $4.6 million&nbsp;in damages for seriously injuring a gas station worker with his car while driving under the influence." A common theme with these rich&nbsp;kids. Good job, Barron.</p><h2 id=akash-ambani---son-of-the-richest-man-in-india><strong>Akash Ambani - Son of The Richest Man In India</strong></h2><p>Akash is an Indian businessman and the chief of strategy of Jio, a 4G service provider. He is the elder son of <a href=#>Mukesh Ambani</a>, who happens to be the richest man in India. Just like many of today's wealthy offspring, he loves to show off his wealth online, especially on Instagram, which happens to be the latest trend.</p><p>Lately, he's&nbsp;more famous&nbsp;for being involved in a car accident that killed two people in Mumbai, India -- very common&nbsp;in the age of rich kids showing off and acting like complete morons. It is also&nbsp;reported that the media blacked out the news to safeguard Akash, who also happens to&nbsp;own&nbsp;and influence most of the leading news channels in the country. Is there a cover up? Details are still sketchy, but it doesn't change the fact that he deserves to be punched in the face before being thrown in jail for murder and his&nbsp;stupid Instagram photos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dorothy-wang---daughter-of-roger-wang><strong>Dorothy Wang - Daughter Of Roger Wang</strong></h2><p>Speaking of Instagram, the&nbsp;Rich Kids of Beverly Hills&nbsp;have basically taken over this app and made it as mainstream as any other app or social media site. And the leader of this gang of spoiled brats, who has&nbsp;helped start this trend of showing off their ridiculously rich lifestyle, is <a href=#>Dorothy Wang</a>, the daughter of <a href=#>Roger Wang</a>. Mr. Wang&nbsp;is the CEO of Golden Eagle International Group, which owns China's largest mall chains. His net worth is almost $4 billion, according to Forbes.</p><p>After Rich Kids premiered, Wang transferred her popularity to Instagram, gaining over 50,000 followers on&nbsp;the first day. You can now see her flaunting her wealth and acting like a stuck up rich kid on a daily basis. Other irritating rich kids like <a href=#>Morgan Stewart</a> and countless other&nbsp;reality stars have followed with their own&nbsp;egocentric photos of themselves. It's the worst.</p><h2 id=jaden-smith><strong>Jaden Smith</strong></h2><p>Does anyone else feel like when they see <a href=#>Jaden</a>, it always seems like he's about to do a number 2? He's always got that look on his face, and his acting sucks. Thankfully, we haven't seen him in any films lately, and we hope it stays that way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everything about Jaden is beyond aggravating. His quotes, tweets, Instagram posts, style, attention-seeking, and everything else he does is simply cringeworthy. <a href=#>Will Smith</a> needs to do us all a favor and get this kid out of our lives. Send him to a deserted island and keep him there.</p><p>Here's an example: "I have a goal to be just the most craziest person of all time. And when I say craziest, I mean, like, I want to do like Olympic-level things. I want to be the most durable person on the planet." What does that even mean? He needs to be punched and exiled ASAP.</p><h2 id=robert-cavalli---son-of-roberto><b>Robert</b><strong>&nbsp;Cavalli - Son Of Roberto</strong></h2><p>The youngest son of fashion legend <a href=#>Roberto Cavalli</a> and Eva Duringer, Robert, is another little pr--k living off his family's fame and fortune. Robert, aka Robin, currently lives in London and attends Regent's University London, where he&nbsp;is majoring in waiting for his father to die to inherit millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has a full-time job posting pictures of himself and his rich little Euro buddies eating caviar and throwing money all over the place. He loves taking selfies of himself to make sure everyone knows exactly how rich he is&nbsp;and how&nbsp;much personality he is&nbsp;lacking. At least he has over 120,000 Instagram followers to support his soulless ego. He's a total wanker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXae2pLSMqZyoqJyaeri0zmaYq51dqLxurc2nprKhnpx6urvUZq6apqRiwbB5z66lnKBdnrtuwMeeZJ%2BZk5p8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-relationship-again-2018-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Signs That Prove Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt Are Getting Back Together</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-actors-that-have-died-the-most-on-screen.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Actors That Have Died The Most On Screen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
