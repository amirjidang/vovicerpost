Whether they’re perky beauty gurus showing viewers how to get their look, talented musicians recording innovative covers, or just fitness enthusiasts posting endless gym selfies of their enviable body, it’s no longer as difficult to become a star as it once was. When you think of celebrities who have reached stratospheric heights of superstardom seemingly out of the blue, one of the first names that comes to mind is likely Kim Kardashian. Back in the 2000s, Kardashian was just one of the secondary members of Paris Hilton’s socialite squad – she went to a few red carpet events, but basically, no one knew who she was by name. Then, an X-rated tape of her and former partner Ray J went viral, and suddenly everyone knew Kim’s name. Her shrewd momager managed to take that media attention and snag a reality show for Kim and the family – Keeping Up With The Kardashians. You may have heard of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim has catapulted herself to stardom, marrying rapper Kanye West, sitting in the front row of fashion shows, pulling in countless viewers every week who are curious to see anything she does on the show. However, Keeping Up With The Kardashians has been on the air since 2007 and viewers have sat through 10 seasons of the family’s antics. Sooner or later, the public will tire of Kim and be looking for the next curvy superstar – and we’re here to say that the next Kim K will most definitely be rising singer Niykee Heaton. Not sure you agree, or simply not sure who Heaton is? Well, we’re going to make our case. Here are 10 reasons that Niykee Heaton is the next Kim Kardashian.</p><h2 id=10-she-has-curves><strong>10. She Has Curves</strong></h2><p>via onlinenewspaper.spatepost.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let’s be honest – one of the biggest parts of Kim Kardashian’s fame comes from the junk she has in the trunk. Sure, Jennifer Lopez made it cooler to have a booty back in the early 2000s, but Kim is really the one who started the curvy derriere obsession in society. Suddenly, women were doing endless squats and buying waist trainers in an attempt to get that enviable exaggerated hourglass figure. Well, step aside Kim – Niykee Heaton has curves for days. In comparison to many rising starlets whose extreme slimness has rendered their bodies nearly androgynous, Heaton has a definite hourglass figure, and carries a lot of her weight in her lower half, just like Kim.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-she-s-naturally-beautiful><strong>9. She's&nbsp;Naturally&nbsp;Beautiful</strong></h2><p>via rsvlts.com</p><p>Admittedly, Kim Kardashian’s type of beauty isn’t for everyone. She’s a pretty girl when make-up free, but her true stunning appearance comes from masterful make-up application. I mean, she’s basically the girl who made contouring a thing, allowing women around the world to create new cheekbones for themselves out of bronzer and thin air. However, when you see her selfies or her poses on red carpets, it’s undeniable that Kim is a gorgeous girl. If you’ve ever seen a picture of Niykee Heaton, you’d agree that she’s just as gorgeous, if not more so. While Kim is a glamorous, fully made-up brunette bombshell, Niykee is a bit more natural, rocking tousled dirty blonde locks, and a make-up look that consists primarily of gloss, no complex eyeliner or impeccable lipstick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-she-has-actual-talent><strong>8. She Has Actual Talent</strong></h2><p>Okay, before all you Kim Kardashian fans start shrieking, yes, we know that she’s managed to keep the public’s interest for season after season, and has branched out to entrepreneurial ventures like the boutique she runs with her sisters. Yes, she’s basically the queen of contouring. However, at the end of the day… she doesn’t actually have much talent that would set her apart from other rising starlets. That’s where Niykee Heaton steps in. Sure, her Instagram feed is mostly provocative selfies and thirst traps, but if you’ve ever listened to her covers or her original tracks, you’ll know that she actually has a pretty amazing voice. Whereas reality shows eventually run their course, a career in the music industry can easily stretch out across decades, from becoming a rising star performer to a veteran producer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-she-has-a-strong-social-media-following><strong>7. She Has A Strong Social Media Following</strong></h2><p>Not many people in the world have the type of social media following that Kim Kardashian has – I mean, 47.1 million followers is a lot. However, despite still being a rising star and not exactly an established household name, Niykee Heaton has already managed to amass over a million followers – 1.6 million at the latest count, to be exact. Now, given the types of images she posts, yes, a large majority of those followers are likely men who are more concerned with her curves than her talent, but hey – a following is a following. Heaton has managed to flaunt what she’s got in order to get attention and exposure, and her strategy is definitely working.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-she-has-youth-on-her-side><strong>6.&nbsp;She Has Youth On Her Side</strong></h2><p>via empireave.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian is now well into her 30s, and reality television is really a young person’s game. Sure, she could become one of the next Real Housewives – which, honestly, we would love. Can you even imagine Kim, North and Kanye bringing the drama every week? But once the Kardashian empire runs its course and E! stops renewing it, Kim will have to figure out her next career move. Heaton is only 20 years old, just starting out in the entertainment industry. She has nothing but time, and nowhere to go but up, so while Kim’s stock is eventually going to dip downwards, hers will only continue to soar.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-she-has-musical-connections><strong>5. She Has Musical Connections</strong></h2><p>via vh1.com</p><p>For better or for worse, Kim Kardashian has always had ties to the world of hip hop and R&B. Her first husband, back when she was in her early 20s, was an R&B and pop music producer. Her initial claim to fame was an X-rated tape with rapper Ray J. And, of course, she’s now married to rapper Kanye West. While Niykee may not have landed herself a husband in the music industry yet, she’s covered songs of pretty much all the big names in hip hop and R&B – and some artists have started to take notice of her talent and reach out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-she-made-a-video-that-went-viral><strong>4. She Made A Video That Went Viral</strong></h2><p>Everyone knows the story of Kim Kardashian’s viral video – the public loves scandal, and the minute an X-rated video was released starring Kim and Ray J, suddenly everyone knew exactly who she was. While it’s not necessarily the route everyone wants to take for fame, she managed to capitalize on her 15 minutes of fame and parlay that into nearly a decade of being a tabloid staple and reality show superstar. While Niykee Heaton hasn’t revealed all of herself in a sex tape, many of her YouTube videos have gone viral – her cover of Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa” has over 3 million views and won her the attention of her agent.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-she-posts-tons-of-revealing-selfies><strong>3. She Posts Tons Of Revealing Selfies</strong></h2><p>via theyoutubebuzz.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian has long been known as the queen of the selfie – I mean, for goodness sake, she even released a book consisting entirely of her perfected art form of choice. It’s something that her 47+ million followers have come to know and love, and she mixes up the duck face selfies with bikini shots to keep everyone interested. Niykee Heaton has definitely gotten the memo that revealing selfies = more followers, as she’s about half naked in nearly every selfie she takes, rocking tiny panties, tugged and tied up shirts, and similar outfits.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-she-s-spent-time-with-kanye><strong>2. She’s Spent Time With Kanye</strong></h2><p>via rsvlts.com</p><p>It’s safe to say that Kim Kardashian has spent a fair amount of time with Kanye West – I mean, she’s married to the guy, they have a child together. However, what you may not know is that Niykee Heaton has met him too – and not just while passing him on a red carpet or at a favorite haunt in Chicago. Heaton was working on some music with a few people in a tiny rented studio room, and a knock on the door came – and then Kanye stepped in. He told Heaton he’d been following her on Instagram and asked to hear some stuff. She played her new material, including a half-formed beat that he offered some ideas for. Sure, Kim married him, but has she collaborated musically with him? Because Niykee might.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-she-s-not-a-stranger-to-criticism><strong>1. She's Not A&nbsp;Stranger To Criticism</strong></h2><p>via the305.com</p><p>For every one of Kim Kardashian’s devoted followers, there are about ten critics who think she’s famous for absolutely nothing and receives a ridiculous amount of attention. She’s received hateful comments for her appearance while pregnant, for her overly made-up look, and much more. Though she’s often shown her vulnerability on her reality show, Kardashian manages to put on a brave face for the public and shoulder on despite the negativity. Heaton is learning to take a page from her book and do the same. Niykee Heaton has shared tales of being bullied as a child, has been somewhat vocal about issues she faced with her label earlier in her career, and has had to address the haters who claim she’s just posting endless thirst traps on her Instagram. She knows, just like Kim, that at the end of the day it’s about your fans, not your haters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>vh1.com</a>, <a href=#>webcitation.org</a>, <a href=#>instagram.com/niykeeheaton</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2nsqK%2FzqeqZqaZrrimsYyhnJqsn6N6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZ6axbV5yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-pictures-that-define-kim-kardashians-luxurious-lifestyle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Pictures That Define Kim Kardashian's Luxurious Lifestyle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./air-jordans-most-valuable.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Most Valuable Air Jordans Ever Made</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
