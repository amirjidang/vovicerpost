According to lucky fans who got a sneak peek of “Lunch,” the track features lyrics about a <a href=#>same-sex relationship</a>, such as “I could eat that girl for lunch / Yeah, she dances on my tongue / Tastes like she might be the one / And I can never get enough / I could buy you so much stuff / It’s a craving, not a crush.”</p><p>Eilish went on to tell Rolling Stone that she previously never planned on discussing her sexuality “in a million years,” adding, “It’s really frustrating to me that it came up.”</p><p>The singer seemingly referred to her November 2023 profile with <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>, in which she admitted she was “attracted” to women “for real.” The following month, she <a href=#>accused the outlet of outing her</a> with the story, writing via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, “Thanks variety for my award and for also outing me on a red carpet at 11 am instead of talking about anything else that matters i like boys and girls leave me alone about it please literally who cares stream ‘what was i made for’🥸.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/billie-eilish-opens-up-about-her-sexuality.jpg><p>At Variety’s Hitmakers event in December 2023, Eilish said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>red carpet interview</a> that she thought her sexuality was “obvious” and “didn’t realize people didn’t know.”</p><p>Eilish told Rolling Stone that at the time, she felt like she didn’t have “control” over news of her sexuality breaking. “Nobody should be pressured into being one thing or the other, and I think that there’s a lot of wanting labels all over the place,” she explained. “Dude, I’ve known people that don’t know their sexuality, or feel comfortable with it, until they’re in their forties, fifties, sixties. It takes a while to find yourself, and I think it’s really unfair, the way that the internet bullies you into talking about who you are and what you are.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/billie-eilish-opens-up-about-her-sexuality-inline.jpg><p>She continued: “I went into Billie Eilish interview mode, [like], ‘Oh, I don’t care. Yeah, I’ll say whatever. Wasn’t it obvious?’ And then afterwards I was like, ‘Wait. It wasn’t obvious to me.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite being romantically linked to stars such as <strong>Brandon Quention Adams</strong>, <strong>Matthew Tyler Vorce</strong> and <strong>Jesse Rutherford</strong> over the years, Eilish told Rolling Stone she’s “only figuring myself out now.” She added: “And honestly, what I said was funny, because I really was just saying what they’ve all been saying.”</p><p>The Oscar winner wrapped up the topic by stating she’s “lucky enough to be in a time when I’m able to say something like that and things go OK for me. And that’s not how a lot of people’s experience is.”</p><p>Eilish’s new album Hit Me Hard and Soft drops on May 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboZyhtqZ5xKKjoquYYryvedKer66ZnJ7BunnIZqmemZyex6awjKJksJmeqbKlecyyZJ%2BZk5p6qrqMmmSvmZeeu6J7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bree-runway-biography-age-height-songs-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bree Runway Biography: Age, Height, Songs, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-xanadu-2-0-bill-gates-124-million-mansion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bill Gates' $124 Million Mansion</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
