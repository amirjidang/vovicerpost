The main office structure at Nike World Headquarters in Oregon bears the tennis great's name in honor of the company. There are enough square feet in the building to fit 140 tennis courts. The two-story, 140-seat theatre inside the building is named after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams' four-year-old daughter Olympia</a>. In the SW building, salvaged materials and products from nearby factories and farms account for almost 20% of the total. It also has up to 648 solar panels.</p><p>At the tender age of three, Olympia Ohanian has all the makings of a future sports star, although she isn't not going to begin her tennis career any time soon. Instead, Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian have made sure that she is a co-owner of the new Los Angeles women's soccer team, 'Angel City.' She is now the league's youngest owner at the age of 21. Olympia stands with her parents, other activists, celebrities, and athletes who want Los Angeles to join the NWSL by 2022.

Their lives are filled with charming twinning moments, tennis lessons, and even red-carpet appearances. Stuart Weitzman's Spring/Summer 2021 ad campaign even features Williams and her mini-me doing their trademark identical clothing routine. In a recent interview, Serena mentioned that Olympia was helping out with her fashion company.</p><p>At the US Open, Olympia was spotted dressing like her mother and wearing the same recognizable white beads on her head.

According to <a href=#>Williams who has achieved so much success</a>, she wants to spend more time at her beautiful Miami home to get some rest. Behind the bookshelf in her home is a secret media room that people can only access through the hidden door that can be seen behind the sculptures of contemporary chairs.</p><p>When one step inside, one will find a stage stocked with instruments, a bar, velvety chairs, and a bright neon sign that reads Serenade; it's the ideal setting for a family karaoke night. Olympia's unique pink castle bed was constructed specifically for her, and it features a built-in slide and a chandelier so that she can truly feel like a princess. It also looks like she has a toy-filled playroom with bright storage cubes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-s-luxurious-vacation-and-lavish-gifts>Olivia's Luxurious Vacation And Lavish Gifts</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympia Ohanian</a> is undoubtedly making the most of her summer.

The co-creator of Reddit isn't simply splurging his kid with books, though. Ohanian posted a photo of the miniature Thor's hammer he had gotten for Olympia in anticipation of her seeing Thor: Ragnarok which stars <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth who has magnificent watch collection</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexis recently shared on social media that he had made a piece of jewelry inspired by his daughter's artwork.</p><p>Earlier, he had prepared some artistic pancakes that looked good for Olympia.
