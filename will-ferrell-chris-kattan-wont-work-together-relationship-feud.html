Because of this, the world has gotten stars like <a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a> and <a href=#>Adam Sandler</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Ferrell rose to prominence on SNL, and early on in his career, he did a lot of work with another SNL performer. The pair were great together, but a rift drove them apart and saw them stop working together.</p><p>Let's take a look at why Will Ferrell does not work with his former SNL partner.</p><h2 id=will-ferrell-is-a-comedy-powerhouse>Will Ferrell Is A Comedy Powerhouse</h2><p>When it comes to the biggest comedic actors of the last 25 years, there aren't many names that can legitimately contend with Will Ferrell. At his peak, he was a comedy dynamo who was starring in blockbuster hits that net him millions of fans and millions of dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ferrell got his big break on Saturday Night Live, and from there, he would transition to the big screen flawlessly. Sure, every film that he has done has not been a massive hit, but his collection of big movies could make any comedic performer jealous.</p><p>Movies like Austin Powers, Old School, Zoolander, Elf, Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys all had a hand in making Ferrell one of the most popular actors on the planet.</p><p>While his recent offerings have not been quite on the same level as the work that he was doing earlier on in his career, there is simply no way that Ferrell can be considered anything less than one of the biggest stars of his era. Thanks to this, he has a net worth of $160 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p>Earlier on in his career, Ferrell had done quite a bit of work with another SNL performer, and these two were simply hilarious with one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Ferrel, Jon Favreu, Ed Helms, And Others Join 'Elf For Georgia' Table Read To Benefit Georgia Democrats</a></span></p><h2 id=he-did-loads-of-work-with-chris-kattan>He Did Loads Of Work With Chris Kattan</h2><p>The comedic chemistry that Will Ferrell had with Chris Kattan was evident on SNL, and their sketches together gave way to some hilarious moments. Their chemistry was so great that they even got to do work on the big screen together.</p><p>A Night at the Roxbury might be a silly '90s flick to most, but this movie has been quoted for ages, and it's all thanks to the work that Ferrell and Kattan put in. They were just too good as Doug and Steve Butabi (yes, they're brothers), and fans could not get enough of their dancing and their hilarious recollection of meeting Emilio Estevez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the history that the duo share, it's become quite clear to fans that something drove a wedge between them, given their lack of work together in recent years. This has led many to wonder about what took place and how it impacted their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How A Fight Scene In 'The Other Guys' Almost Led To Eva Mendes Stabbing Will Ferrell</a></span></p><h2 id=why-he-won-39-t-work-with-him-anymore>Why He Won't Work With Him Anymore</h2><p>So, why won't Will Ferrell work with his old buddy Chris Kattan anymore? Well, Kattan has shed some light on what took place and why the duo aren't ever seen with one another in projects anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Kattan</a>, the relationship that he had with Amy Heckerling was the reason why Ferrell stopped being friends with him. This relationship, according to Kattan's memoir, was one that he was pressured into by Lorne Michaels.</p><p>As Kattan wrote, "I had tried to hide my relationship with Amy, not realizing how obvious it had been to everyone else, including Will (not to mention that Lorne told him about it in the first place)."</p><p>When the duo were reunited on SNL, Ferrell is alleged to have told Kattan, "So, I got all your messages, but I didn’t call you back because I didn’t want to talk to you."</p><p>"I don’t want to be your friend anymore. I’m going to be professional and still work with you on the show, but that’s it," Ferrell is alleged to have said.</p><p>It is really important to keep in mind that this is Kattan's side of things, as Ferrell has yet to go public with anything regarding the former friends. Nevertheless, it does shed an interesting light on what could have driven a wedge between the once hilarious duo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Will Ferrell And Luke Wilson Were Originally Rejected In 'Old School'</a></span></p><p>Perhaps one day, Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell can put this all behind them and work on something together.
