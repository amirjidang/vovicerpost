For several years in the 1990s, Allman performed around the growing St. Louis Blues and rock music scene, while also managing a suburban Guitar Center store where he met his future Royal Southern Brotherhood bandmate, Mike Zito.</p><p>During his twenties, he tried various musical styles and sounds to distance himself from his father’s sound and avoid obvious comparisons, though his father did not meddle in his career. Devon embraced the blues and rock genres during his thirties.</p><p>He grew up on classic, blues-inspired rock music, and has specifically mentioned Santana, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, and The Allman Brothers Band as influences, as well as heavy metal acts such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, and Testament.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-devon-allman></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Devon Allman</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-devon-allman></span><span>Who is Devon Allman?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Devon Allman is an American guitarist, vocalist, keyboardist, songwriter, and record producer who has performed occasionally as a guest musician for Gregg Allman and The Allman Brothers Band.
