With only a handful of successful exceptions, most Marvel and DC movies flopped historically badly at the box office, <a href=#>with many claiming superhero fatigue is to blame</a>.</p><p>Still, Deadpool 3 is expected to be a smash hit, in part because it is slated to be the only MCU movie released in 2024. On February 11th, during Super Bowl LVIII, the first official trailer for Deadpool 3 dropped, setting the internet ablaze.</p><p>Within 24 hours, the Deadpool 3 trailer racked up over 356 million views on YouTube, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breaking the record for the most-viewed movie trailer</a> and heightening the film's already immense buzz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The trailer not only confirmed the official title – Deadpool & Wolverine – but also displayed the Merc's hilarious interactions with the Time Variance Authority (TVA), hinting at a multiversal adventure that could shake the very foundations of the MCU.</p><p>This, coupled with the sensational return of <a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a>'s Wolverine, raises a box office question: will this explosive cocktail of superhero mayhem mint billions at the box office?</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/x-men-movies-in-order-of-box-office-gross.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Captain Deadpool!</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Highest-Grossing X-Men Movies, Ranked By Box Office Receipts</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Marvel isn't the only franchise in town.

While Deadpool 3 might be R-rated, the character's self-aware humor and meta-references perfectly align with the MCU's recent exploration of the multiverse and its penchant for humor.</p><p>This playful approach could bridge the gap between the established MCU audience and newcomers unfamiliar with Deadpool's universe. Whether "The Marvel Jesus" truly "saves the Marvel Universe" in his third coming is yet to be seen.</p><p>Still, its connection to the MCU's legacy and brand recognition undoubtedly places it in a prime position to succeed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This unorthodox superhero team-up has the potential to not only revive the box office but also redefine the boundaries of the MCU, proving that even a foul-mouthed mercenary can find redemption and success within the shared superhero universe.</p><h2 id=ryan-reynolds-39-and-hugh-jackman-39-s-star-power>Ryan Reynolds' And Hugh Jackman's Star Power</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/deadpool-3-wolverine.jpg><p>Another crucial element driving Deadpool 3 towards potential billion-dollar territory is the undeniable star power of its leading duo: Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.</p><p>Reynolds is the creative force behind the Deadpool franchise, and the one responsible for bringing the Merc with a Mouth to life on the big screen.</p><p>His relentless passion for the character translated into two commercially and critically acclaimed Deadpool films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This established fanbase eagerly awaits Deadpool 3, fueled by Reynolds' trademark wit and comedic timing, ensuring a strong opening weekend and dedicated viewership throughout the film's run.</p><p>The first Deadpool movie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grossed over $132.4 million on its opening weekend</a>, breaking 2003's The Matrix Reloaded's record of having the highest opening weekend for an R-rated movie.</p><p>The sequel set the record for the highest opening for a 20th Century Fox film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grossing $125.5 million</a> in the traditional three-day weekend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/deadpool-3-trailer.jpg><p>Alongside Reynolds stands the iconic return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.

Joker broke the mold, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">surpassing a billion</a>, but films like Logan, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which grossed $619 million</a> worldwide, and The Batman ($770 million), fell short.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While these numbers are impressive, they demonstrate the potential ceiling for R-rated superhero films compared to their PG-13 counterparts, like Spider-Man: No Way Home ($1.9 billion) and Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness ($955 million).</p><p>However, there are – again – reasons to be optimistic about Deadpool & Wolverine.</p><p>First, the MCU itself has shown adaptability with respect to R-rated content on its streaming service, Disney+. This suggests a potential willingness to experiment with a wider range of ratings for Deadpool 3 within the MCU framework.</p><p>Second, recent audience trends indicate a continued appetite for mature content.</p><p>R-rated films like Top Gun: Maverick, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crossed the billion dollar mark</a> ($1.3 billion), and Oppenheimer ($959 million), thrived at the box office, suggesting adult-only content can in fact go for the big B.</p><p>Ultimately, the R-rating remains a double-edged sword.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it might limit access to younger demographics, it could also attract adult audiences seeking a different superhero experience. Whether this trade-off proves beneficial for Deadpool 3's billion-dollar aspirations remains to be seen.</p><p>The success of the film's marketing campaign and its ability to appeal to both existing fans and curious newcomers will be crucial in determining if the R-rating ultimately acts as a friend or foe at the box office.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tom-holland-net-worth-2024.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Little Avenger</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Spider-Man Of Means: Tom Holland's Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tom Holland's net worth became a topic of interest after a gargantuan "bonus" was accidentally sent to fellow British actor Tom Hollander.</span><h2 id=minting-billions-the-verdict>Minting Billions?
