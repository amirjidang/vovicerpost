When they returned all three brothers were married and living their lives. Kevin Jonas was the<a href=#> first to get married.</a> He married Danielle Deleasa in 2009. They have two daughters together- Alena and Valentina. Danielle was not famous when they first met but has since established a name for herself amongst the fandom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe Jonas maried Game of Thrones actress, Sophie Turner in 2019. <a href=#>They had two ceremonies</a>. In July 2020, Joe and Sophie welcomed their first child, a daughter. No official name was released, but rumors have said it's either Will or Hannah. And Nick Jonas married actress Priyanka Jonas in 2018, after only 6 months of dating. They <a href=#>also had numerous ceremonies</a>, celebrating their Hindu and Christian religions. The couple does not have any kids yet.</p><p>So, amongst these six, who has the highest net worth this year?</p><h2 id=danielle-jonas---5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Danielle Jonas - $5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no surprise that out of everyone in the Jonas clan, Danielle has the lowest net worth. Despite being married to a Jonas Brother, she is not technically famous, though she has established a great career and life for herself. Before she married Kevin, Danielle worked as a hairdresser, which earned her a reasonable income but nothing like it is today. Just by herself, Danielle Jonas' net worth in 2021, is estimated to be around $5 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>From 2012 to 2013, she and Kevin appeared on the reality show, Married to Jonas, which chronicled their newly-wed life and family life, which they probably still earn residuals from. In 2018, the 35-year-old founded Danielle Jonas Co., a jewelry company based around birthstones. The company is pretty successful and earns her a lot of income. She is set to release a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">children's book, "There's A Rock Concert In My Bedroom", </a>in March, 2022, which will only increase her net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sophie-turner---8-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sophie Turner - $8 Million</span></h2><p>Despite Sophie Turner being the Queen of the North, she is not the richest out of the six. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Turner is estimated to have a net worth of $8 million in 2021. There's no doubt Game of Thrones contributed the most to her income, which she was on from 2011 to 2019. The Emmy-nominated actress has also starred in the X-Men film series, Dark Phoenix, Barely Lethal and more.</p><p>Turner has also been featured in ads for Louis Vuitton. The 25-year-old actress is currently starring in The Prince and The Staircase, which will both add to her net worth. Being the youngest of the group, it's not a surprise that her net worth isn't as high as the others. She will only get more popular as time goes on and, therefore, her net worth will increase. Her and Joe also just bought a $14 million mansion in California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>18 Sweet Photos From Joe, Nick And Kevin Jonas' Weddings</a></span></p><h2 id=priyanka-chopra-jonas---30-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Priyanka Chopra Jonas - $30 Million</span></h2><p>Priyanka Chopra Jonas is one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the highest-paid Indian actresses</a>, according to Forbes. Websites estimate her net worth to be around $30 to $45 million, with her earning at least $10 million a year. Being the oldest of the group, she has been in the entertainment business the longest and has earned a massive net worth. Her career started in 2002, but she rose to prominence in in 2005 when she starred in six films, including Yakeen and Barsaat. The 39-year-old started out in Bollywood films before moving to bigger Hollywood roles, such as Baywatch, Quantico, Isn't It Romantic? and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with being an actress, she is also a producer, singer, model and writer. Chopra Jonas released her memoir, Unfinished, in February 2021. The actress is also an endorser for many companies, such as Pepsi, Nikon, Pantene, Garnier, Lyf Mobile and more, which account for half of her income. She has also invested in a lot of companies, including Bumble, and owns a total of nine properties. Her and Nick recently bought a $20 million mansion.</p><h2 id=kevin-jonas---40-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kevin Jonas - $40 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A significant jump happens between the wives and the brothers. Kevin Jonas' net worth is estimated to be around $40 to $50 million, according to multiple websites. When the Jonas Brothers broke up, Kevin went back to living a normal life.
