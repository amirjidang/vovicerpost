HGTV told viewers to expect 14 more hour-length episodes in an "expanded second season."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Per HGTV, the new season would start in "early 2024." Yet by April 2024, there was no news about the series, nor was there a tentative release date. While both Heather Rae and Tarek have been active on social media — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather Rae promoted a flip the couple did off-air on her Instagram</a> — they didn't seem to know when to expect their second season to air, either.</p><p>Heather wrote in response to a fan comment, "we don’t have an air date yet! Hopefully later this year..??" on April 5th, 2024. That's not much to go off of, but it could be that the season has wrapped filming and just hasn't gone on the air yet.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-flipping-el-moussas-tarek-heather-el-moussa.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tenants Speak Out As Tarek El Moussa’s New Condo Project Forces Them Out Of Their Homes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tarek has defended the project on multiple occasions, but now the tenants are going to the media.</span><p>Since Tarek and Heather Rae's first season ended right before the birth of their son, who turned one year old in February 2024, it's assumed that season two picked up when he was a newborn. In fact, that's what Heather wrote on Instagram while celebrating the show's renewal. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tarek also wrote about the couple's "FIRST flip of season 2"</a> hitting the market in November 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, the lack of news about the series had viewers wondering what was going on, and whether The Flipping El Moussas might never air after all. To some prospective viewers, that concept wasn't a bad thing.</p><h3 id=is-heather-rae-still-working-on-selling-sunset>Is Heather Rae still working on Selling Sunset?</h3><p>Heather Rae El Moussa is still a realtor, but she's no longer affiliated with Selling Sunset's Oppenheimer Group, according to El Moussa herself. In an interview with People when her son was nine months old, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather spoke about her time on Selling Sunset</a> and wanting to get away from the drama.</p><p>"I love being able to prioritize my family and my happiness and step away from some of the drama that Selling Sunset brought into my life. A lot of things happened that I choose not to speak about, but overall I am very happy with how my life is."</p><p><a href=#>Heather has been up-front about her disappearance from Selling Sunset being about more than her maternity leave</a>, but she's clearly moved on since — even if <a href=#>the reality star's income may have suffered in the lead-up to her leaving Selling Sunset</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/christina-hall-tarek-el-moussa.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Heather El Moussa Get Banned By Selling Sunset?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Heather El Moussa's new show with her husband might have ruined her fate on Selling Sunset.</span><h2 id=the-flipping-el-moussas-wasn-39-t-as-well-received-as-flip-or-flop>The Flipping El Moussas Wasn't As Well-Received As Flip Or Flop</h2><h3 id=despite-tarek-39-s-success-with-his-ex-wife-his-new-show-never-matched-up>Despite Tarek's success with his ex-wife, his new show never matched up</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_why-heather-rae-el-moussa-really-quit-selling-sunset-_bk_a1.jpg><p>Calling The Flipping El Moussas a "wife swap flop," The Sun reported that the show's first season was a bust. The premiere of The Flpiping El Moussas racked up 796,000 viewers, which might sound impressive, especially for a new show. But for experienced reality TV personality Tarek, the viewership wasn't great.</p><p>Not to mention, Flip or Flop's season premiere attracted over 1.1 million viewers, blowing the new series out of the water. During Flip or Flop's finale, the show brought in 1.6+ million viewers. The Flipping El Moussas was in good company, though; <a href=#>Tarek's ex-wife Christina</a> had similar luck with her new show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tarek El Moussa’s Relationship History Before Marrying Christina Hall And Heather Rae Young Is Downright Dramatic</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tarek El Moussa has had two public marriages, but who did he date prior to falling in love with Christina Hall and Heather Rae Young?</span><p>Christina in the Country's premiere had 744,000 premiere viewers, and the finale brought in 768,000 viewers. Unfortunately for the exes, bringing their new partners onto their respective reality shows didn't seem to have the same impact as the formerly happy couple did on ratings.</p><p>Given how poorly Tarek and Heather Rae's show did during its first season, critics were quick to assume that the show would be cancelled outright, but that didn't happen. While waiting for the second season, fans didn't hesitate to drag the series, saying it wasn't worth renewing at all.</p><h2 id=some-viewers-are-calling-for-an-end-to-the-flipping-el-moussas>Some Viewers Are Calling For An End To The Flipping El Moussas</h2><h3 id=ratings-are-low-and-fans-are-unhappy-with-tarek-el-moussa>Ratings are low, and fans are unhappy with Tarek El Moussa</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Viewer ratings of The Flipping El Moussas have not been favorable, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb reporting a user-generated score of four out of ten stars in The Flipping El Moussas' first season</a>. The primary problem that most reported was the focus shifting away from the property flipping and toward Heather Rae.</p><p>"It's not the loss of Christina per se, it's the focus of the show... at the end of the hour, we don't even know if they turned a profit."</p><p>One review pointed out that instead of focusing on the struggle to make money off of flips, which Flip or Flop did, The Flipping El Moussas focused more on Heather Rae's doctor appointments and the couple's interactions on camera. Others lamented Heather Rae's lack of interest or perhaps knowledge of the house flipping process.</p><p>"​​​​​​​And the wife. She's supposed to be a realtor but she's totally clueless about how much it costs to renovate houses. How is that possible? I think we've been lied to on this."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other comments called The Flipping El Moussas "sad," "disappointing," and flat-out "terrible." While the comments attached to lower-star reviews were overall scathing and the majority of the feedback, there were fans of the show who gave it anywhere from seven to 10 stars.</p><p>​​​​​​​Given that HGTV opted to renew the series, despite delays, could suggest that there's still a market for the El Moussas, even if they've alienated Flip or Flop fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqbWmecWloKmomaO0brHLZqSoraOorrR5xp6rZpuRo7CmuMuem2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gary-dourdan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Gary Dourdan dating?
