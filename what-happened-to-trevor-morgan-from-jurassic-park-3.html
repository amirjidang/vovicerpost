But for most people, it's the Joe Johnston directed Jurassic Park 3 that's the greatest offense. After all, <a href=#>the film is filled with unanswered questions</a> and a pretty lackluster plot. But one thing that wasn't a mistake about the 2001 blockbuster was the casting of Trevor Morgan as Eric Kirby, AKA the kid in Jurassic Park 3. And that kid is no longer a kid, by the way... He's 35... which should make just about every fan and critic of Jurassic Park 3 feel very, very old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Trevor was doing his fair share of acting prior to being hand-picked by Steven Spielberg for the second sequel in the franchise. He appeared in The Sixth Sense, The Patriot, and in five episodes of ER. But Jurassic Park 3 was his big break. At least, it should've been. Without a doubt, Trevor's career didn't take off at the speed that he likely expected it to. This had led fans to wonder what exactly happened to him and what he's up to now...</p><h2 id=is-trevor-morgan-still-acting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Trevor Morgan Still Acting?</span></h2><p>While Trevor Morgan may not have the insane, non-stop career that many would've expected, he certainly is still acting. In fact, he had a couple of acclaimed projects added to his resume following the release of Jurassic Park 3. This includes independent films like 2004's Mean Creek, 2010's Brotherhood, and 2011's Vampire, which premiered at Sundance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Trevor was cast in David Fincher's HBO series Videosyncrazy. He also starred alongside Toni Braxton in Lifetime's Faith Under Fire. Other notable credits since Jurassic Park 3 are The Grounds, Buttwhistle, Abducted, Magic Hour, and Concrete Kids.</p><h2 id=trevor-morgan-is-writing-and-directing><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Trevor Morgan Is Writing And Directing</span></h2><p>Trevor Morgan has been trying his hand at writing and directing, not unlike many actors at some point in their careers. He has posted on Instagram about taking Robert McKee's story workshop and he has directed a couple of short films. Most notably, Margaret And The Moon in 2016. The film was a fairly decent hit at various short film festivals around The United States. In 2019, Trevor also directed a documentary called Fake about consumer culture and the propaganda inherent within it. He also owns his own production company in Chicago, where he lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trevor-morgan-39-s-girlfriend><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Trevor Morgan's Girlfriend</span></h2><p>After five years of being together, Trevor proposed to his girlfriend Paulina Olszynski in 2018. Paulina is also an actor, most recognizable from the horror film My Soul To Take. As of April 30, when Paulina last posted about Trevor (at the time of this writing) the two still haven't tied the knot. They are going on 9 years together and it appears that their wedding has been postponed but is still very much on the horizon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When she announced their engagement in 2018 on Instagram, Paulina wrote, "A beach day with two friends turned into the greatest surprise of my life. Trevor, I can’t wait to call you my husband. We have been on one crazy adventure together since we met and I wouldn’t have had it any other way. We get to live out all of our dreams that we have always wanted TOGETHER. You have been my rock, strength, support, shoulder and biggest cheerleader in my life. You believed in me when I couldn’t find the way to believe in myself. I am so blessed and grateful that God brought us together. I love you more than anything in this world and I can’t wait till the day we get to say “I do.” I love you. I love you. I love you"</p><h2 id=trevor-morgan-volunteers-with-seniors><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Trevor Morgan Volunteers With Seniors</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A year ago, prior to the pandemic, I started volunteering with my local senior center. They started the ‘friendly companion’ program that pairs lonely seniors with volunteers to simply...be their friend," Trevor wrote in one Instagram post from 2020. "I strongly urge anyone who is interested, or would enjoy fostering a relationship that would be a positive experience in another’s life please reach out to your local senior center. There are many programs like this, and during the pandemic most of our interactions have been over the phone for obvious reasons. It takes one hour a week and it keeps up good spirits. We always talk about how deadly the virus is, specifically to the elderly, but rarely discuss the damage it can pose on those who already have a lack of social interactions and live life with incessant loneliness."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why The T-Rex Looked Different In 'Jurassic World' Compared To 'Jurassic Park'</a></span></p><h2 id=trevor-lost-his-brother-joseph-terrence-morgan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Trevor Lost His Brother Joseph Terrence Morgan</span></h2><p>Trevor Morgan was utterly devastated when his younger brother, Joey, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tragically passed away in 2021</a>. Joey was also an actor, appearing in projects like Flower, Scout's Guide To The Zombie Apocalypse, and even some projects with Trevor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Samuel L.

Unfortunately, it is with regret, anger, and unbelievable sadness that I say Joseph Terrence Morgan passed away this morning. He brightened every room with laughter and put smiles on countless faces. He was an unspeakable energy of love. He is survived by his father Michael, aunt Lisa, uncle joe, best friend Paulina, and big brother. Words do not describe the pain that fills his absence. Love you forever buddy. Save a barstool up there for me."</p><h2 id=trevor-morgan-spends-a-lot-of-time-with-his-friends><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Trevor Morgan Spends A Lot Of Time With His Friends</span></h2><p>Among Trevor's best friends was his English bulldog, Buster, who passed away in 2019. But Trevor also has a core of extremely close human friends who he publicly thanked after the death of his brother. They have been with him through thick and thin and believe in him despite no matter how his career looks to the outside world or what terrible thing happens in his personal life. There's no doubt that Trevor Morgan is a very fortunate man who continues to share a lot of "good" with the world including his best buddies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Laura Dern Radically Risked Her Career After 'Jurassic Park' Came Out</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDRnq2oql2ivLOzwKdkn6qfonqrwdGaqqyhk2K9or7KZmpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-wes-moore-kids-mia-and-james-age-gap-family-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are Wes Moore Kids Mia And James?
