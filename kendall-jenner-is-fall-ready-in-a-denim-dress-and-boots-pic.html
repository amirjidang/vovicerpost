The supermodel gave Us major <a href=#>style inspiration</a> while out and about in New York.</p><p>Jenner, 26, was spotted in the Big Apple on Thursday, September 22, rocking a figure-hugging denim dress by Sportmax. The frock featured a midi construction and a flattering cinched waist.</p><p>The reality star paired the look with rounded sunglasses and a caramel-colored fur bag with contrasting black leather accents. On her feet, the runway expert rocked shiny black pointed-toe boots that were finalized with a stiletto heel.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, the TV personality opened up about her fashion evolution in an episode of Vogue’s series, Life in Looks.</p><p>The video started with the memorable animal print dress she wore to the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> season 1 premiere party in 2007. “My mom and Kourtney had a store, a children’s clothing store called Smooch. We would always go there to get all our clothing,” Jenner said. “I’m pretty positive both of these dresses were more than likely from Smooch.”</p><p>Next up was the Hulu star’s first catwalk in 2014. “This was my first high fashion show, and it was for <a href=#>Marc Jacobs</a>. I actually could not believe I was there,” she said of the moment.</p><p>For the big day, Jenner rocked a see-through sweater and loose-fitting pants. “[I] weirdly had little nerves and I think it was because my shoes were relatively flat. I was pretty chill, even though my boobies were out,” Jenner joked.</p><p>Another standout fashion moment from the <a href=#>Kardashians</a> star came in 2018 when she attended <a href=#>the Met Gala</a> with Virgil Abloh. “I loved this Met,” Jenner said. “Virgil had just announced that he was going to be with Louis Vuitton, so he was in Louis Vuitton, and I was in Off White.” (The famed designer, who founded Off White, <a href=#>died in November 2021</a> following a private battle with cancer. He was 41.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kendall-Jenner-is-the-Picture-of-Fall-in-a-Skintight-Denim-Dress-and-Pointed-Toe-Boots.jpg><p>“We worked together really heavily on creating this look for me,” Jenner said of the whimsical white jumpsuit she wore to fashion’s biggest night. Abloh, for his part, looked dapper in a white tuxedo. “Most of our conversations were over FaceTime, but you never felt like there was a disconnect. He was always putting all of his energy into it … You always felt safe in his arms,” she shared.</p><p>The episode concluded with the floral Dolce & Gabbana two-piece set she wore to sister <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>‘s pre-wedding lunch in <a href=#>Portofino, Italy</a>, in May. “A version of this was worn by <strong>Monica Bellucci</strong> in 1997 … So, I felt super honored to be able to wear it,” Jenner said of the vintage number.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Reflecting on her style through the years, Jenner said she’s proud to see how “comfortable” she’s become in her skin.</p><p>“What I see the most at least … is just my comfort level and me evolving into myself. I look back at the first little girl we saw and how uncomfortable she was … and coming into this girl who is a lot more [comfortable.] I’ve found myself as a woman,” Jenner said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Cyr7DApaNmopWju6a%2BjKKqZp6RobluvsSam7JlmaN6onnDnqWipV2Zv6a%2F0maYp5xdl7ywwNJmp6KbXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kenedi-anderson-meet-the-biggest-star-american-idol-has-ever-seen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenedi Anderson: Meet the 'Biggest Star' 'American Idol' Has 'Ever Seen'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kangol-kid-utfo-becomes-first-rap-artist-be-honored-american-cancer-society-101636.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kangol Kid of U.T.F.O.
