When a man asks a woman what she wants, it’s not as difficult to figure out as he might think: If female fashion icon Carrie Bradshaw is anything to go by the answer is, very often, shoes. It’s no secret that women love shoes, and the more attractive, fancy, and stylish the shoes are, the better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On a special occasion women are unlikely to be found wearing flip flops or Crocs. No, she'll most likely be wearing some sort of high heel or stiletto. Women buy shoes for all kinds of reasons - maybe they’re simply gorgeous, or they might be iconic and even historical, or new and trendy. Some women have even admitted to taking their shoe passion too far, like <a title="Celine Dion Net Worth" href=#>Celine Dion</a>’s 3,000 pair collection.</p><p>A good shoe is worth any amount of pain and any amount of money, though the extravagant stilettos on this list might be out of most people’s price range. These are the kinds of heels that turn women into divas and princesses &nbsp;- show-stoppers and head-turners. As our shoe lady Carrie Bradshaw says, “The fact is, sometimes it’s hard to walk in a woman’s shoes. That’s why we need really special ones now and then to make the walk a little more fun.”</p><h2 id=10-borgezie-eternal-diamond-stiletto---216-000><strong>10. Borgezie “Eternal Diamond” Stiletto - $216,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The luxury jeweler House of Borgezie was founded over 20 years ago by famed designer Christopher Michael Shellis. Located in Great Britain, Borgezie has crafted some of the most elegant and expensive women’s adornments, including handbags, veils and, in 2010, these “Eternal Diamond” stilettos.</p><p>This bespoke shoe comes with a 1,000 year guarantee (you read that right) and is comprised of over 2,200 individual diamonds equaling 30 carats. Each shoe is first crafted by a goldsmith before being handed over to a diamond setter. Shellis spent three years developing the shoe and each pair takes a month to create. As he told the Daily Mail: “I quite literally had to reinvent the fundamental principle of classical stiletto construction.”</p><p></p><h2 id=9-borgezie-diamond-princess-constellation-stiletto---331-450><strong>9. Borgezie “Diamond Princess Constellation” Stiletto - $331,450</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Four years after the “Eternal Diamond” stiletto, Christopher Michael Shellis presented the world with the “Diamond Princess Constellation” stiletto, one-upping his own prior achievement. These gorgeous and stunning heels were inspired by the Paul Simon hit, “Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,” and Shellis claims they are his masterpiece.</p><p>The “Princess Constellation” stilettos sparkle with 1,290 diamonds, and they're available in either solid platinum or 18ct gold. These crown jewel heels take three weeks to make and will make any woman look and feel like royalty.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-stuart-weitzman-diamond-dream-stiletto---500-000><strong>8. Stuart Weitzman “Diamond Dream” Stiletto - $500,000</strong></h2><p>Renowned shoe designer Stuart Weitzman teamed up with diamond jewelry designer Kwiat to make these dream shoes. The pair boasts 1,420 30-carat brilliant-cut diamonds, and Weitzman described them as “fit for a queen.” Two delicate circle-bands adorn the ankles, and the elegant toe strap is made of silver. The “Diamond Dream” stilettos made their red carpet debut at the 2007 Academy Awards. It seems fitting that they were worn by Anika Noni Rose, star of the movie “Dreamgirls.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-stuart-weitzman-retro-rose-pumps---1-000-000><strong>7. Stuart Weitzman “Retro Rose” Pumps - $1,000,000</strong></h2><p>Stuart Weitzman’s “Retro Rose” Pumps are the first pair on the list to hit the 7-figure mark. These retro style shoes were inspired by 1940s Hollywood, specifically the ‘T-strap’ style. Atop the silky gold leather pumps of each shoe is a diamond encrusted rose built of 1,800 Kwiat diamonds weighing 100-carats. Adorned on the shoes themselves are 400 more shimmering diamonds.</p><p>The “Retro Rose” pumps caused a bit of controversy when Weitzman chose Juno&nbsp;screenwriter Diablo Cody to show them off at the 2008 Academy Awards. Cody famously refused, calling it a “cheesy publicity stunt.”</p><p></p><h2 id=6-stuart-weitzman-marilyn-monroe-shoes---1-000-000><strong>6. Stuart Weitzman “Marilyn Monroe” Shoes - $1,000,000</strong></h2><p>Another lavish design by Stuart Weitzman, these classy shoes are adorned with a cluster of glimmering Swarovski crystals surrounded by a satin rose. These wonderfully intricate shoes exhibit pure opulence. Not only were they inspired by Marilyn Monroe, but the Swarovski crystals are actually a pair of earrings that she once owned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The shoes were flaunted by Regina King, nominated for her role in “Ray,” at the 2005 Oscars. After the awards, the earrings were replaced with replicas and they were auctioned off at the Celebrity Rags 4 Charity Riches auction for a cool million bucks.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-stuart-weitzman-platinum-guild-stiletto---1-090-000><strong>5. Stuart Weitzman “Platinum Guild” Stiletto - $1,090,000</strong></h2><p>Continuing to dominate this list is Mr. Weitzman, and his next most expensive heels are the “Platinum Guild” stilettos. The platinum shoes are studded with 464 pear and round shaped Kwiat diamonds. What makes them even more exciting is the fact that the ankle strap can be removed and worn as a bracelet or necklace, making these not just a pair of prized stilettos, but also prized jewels!</p><p>Laura Harring of “Mulholland Drive” wore them at the 2002 Academy Awards and she was escorted by three bodyguards. She didn't need to use the ankle strap as a necklace, however, since she was wearing a $27 million necklace already.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-stuart-weitzman-ruby-slippers---1-600-000><strong>4. Stuart Weitzman “Ruby Slippers” - $1,600,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Inspired by the timeless classic “The Wizard of Oz,” these gorgeous heels are crafted from pure platinum and then coated with a red satin finish. The pair is encrusted with 642 rare Burmese rubies weighing 123.33-carats. Weitzman collaborated with Oscar Herman Bros to produce these beauties. They were planned to make an appearance at the 2003 Oscars but were shelved due to the war in the Middle East. They were later unveiled at Harrod’s in London.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-stuart-weitzman-cinderella-slippers---2-000-000><strong>3. Stuart Weitzman “Cinderella Slippers” - $2,000,000</strong></h2><p>Weitzman was inspired by Cinderella’s iconic glass slippers, and he nailed this one, creating a pair of stilettos that are straight out of a fairy tale. These shoes bear 565 diamonds weighing 55 carats between the pair. On the right slipper is a single 5-carat Amaretto diamond worth $1,000,000 on its own. The diamonds are all fitted onto Italian leather with platinum settings. The dazzling shoes were worn by singer Alison Krauss at the 2004 Academy Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-stuart-weitzman-tanzanite-stiletto---2-000-000><strong>2. Stuart Weitzman “Tanzanite” Stiletto - $2,000,000</strong></h2><p>These stunning heels once again boast the intricate craftsmanship and design of Stuart Weitzman. He teamed up with jeweler Eddie LeVian to create these silver leather heels. Encrusted on the ankle strap are 185-carats of beautiful purple-blue tanzanite gemstones from Africa. The toe straps sparkle with 28-carats of diamonds. This, let's face it, mobile jewelry box, sells at a whopping $2,000,000 - making it one of the most expensive pair of heels ever created. These stilettos have yet to hit the red carpet - who'll be the first to strut their stuff in these gorgeous jewels?</p><p></p><h2 id=1-stuart-weitzman-rita-hayworth-heels---3-000-000><strong>1. Stuart Weitzman “Rita Hayworth” Heels - $3,000,000</strong></h2><p>Topping off our list are the “Rita Hayworth” heels, inspired by the iconic movie star from the 1940s. As with the “Tanzanite” stilettos, Weitzman partnered with LeVian to create these drool-worthy shoes. The chocolate-colored heels are a refreshing change from Weitzman’s usually bright and shiny stilettos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A pair of earrings once owned by the Hollywood legend is cradled by the heels’ satin flowers, and each leather shoe is studded with a host of diamonds, sapphires, and rubies to represent the ultimate display of glamour and style. Actress and singer-songwriter Kathleen “Bird” York wore them to the 2006 Academy Awards, and now the pair is owned by Hayworth’s daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGavn6e5pb%2BMamdmpZ%2BowW6x16mcp6uZq7Juv9Oio56spKTAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./these-hollywood-legends-are-die-hard-fans-of-rolex.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These Hollywood Legends Are Die Hard Fans Of Rolex</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-weeknd-used-his-real-70-million-mansion-while-filming-the-idol.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Weeknd Used His Real $70 Million Mansion While Filming The Idol</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
