Despite his famous parentage, Reed has largely stayed out of the public eye and focused on his studies and personal interests.</p><p><strong>1991 – </strong>Reed Paul Jobs was born on <strong>September 22,</strong> in California.</p><p><strong>2010 –</strong> Reed’s father, Steve Jobs, announces that he is stepping down as CEO of Apple due to health reasons.</p><p><strong>2011 –</strong> Steve Jobs passes away on October 5.</p><p><strong>2013 – </strong>Reed graduates from high school and enrols at Stanford University.</p><p><strong>2017 – </strong>Reed graduates from Stanford University with a degree in history.</p><p><strong>2018 – </strong>Reed joins the Stanford MBA program.</p><p><strong>2020 –</strong> Reed graduates from the Stanford MBA program and begins working at the investment firm Emerson Collective, founded by his mother, Laurene Powell Jobs.</p><p>Despite his family’s immense wealth and influence in the tech industry, Reed Paul Jobs has largely shunned the spotlight and pursued his interests. His academic achievements, including earning a degree in history from Stanford University and a master’s degree in business administration, suggest that he is carving out his path rather than simply following in his father’s footsteps. Reed’s work at Emerson Collective, which focuses on social justice initiatives and environmental advocacy, also suggests that he is committed to using his privilege and resources to impact the world positively.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Childhood_and_Early_Life><strong>Childhood and Early Life</strong></span></h3><p>Reed was born on September 22, 1991, and raised in California with his siblings Eve and Erin Jobs and his half-sister Lisa Brennan Jobs. Eve, his younger sister, is in her final year at Stanford University. After his father died of a similar ailment, he began to try to explore the terrible diseases.</p><p>Many believe he made that decision when his father died in October 2011 at 56 from pancreatic cancer. However, his educational background appears to be a little distorted. He went to Stanford and earned a Master’s degree; however, according to his LinkedIn page, he earned a Master’s of Arts rather than a Master’s of Science in his college.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reed-Paul-1024x1024.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Professional_Career><strong>Professional Career</strong></span></h3><p>Reed Paul Jobs hasn’t had the opportunity to work professionally yet. Still, he has had a chance to demonstrate his ability via his job with Emerson Collective, his mother’s social change organization. He is the Health Director there, where he has worked for the past six years, starting in September 2015. Reed’s mother, Laurene, is a successful businesswoman and intelligent investor. She is the executive director of the Emerson Collective Foundation and its creator.</p><p>She is active in philanthropy and campaigns for causes related to education, immigration reform, social justice, and environmental protection. Steve, his father, on the other hand, was a visionary businessman who used technology to work to alter the world. He was an industrial designer, successful investor, and co-founder of Apple Inc.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Relationship_Status><strong>Relationship Status</strong></span></h3><p>He is a very private person with limited information about his relationship status. Meanwhile, Jobs hasn’t been seen with anybody that could be his fiancée or partner. He has also been silent on the subject of his sexuality. There is no information on whether Reed Paul is married or engaged. So, we do not know if Reed has a wife or not.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Height_Weight_and_Physical_Appearances><strong>Height, Weight, and Physical Appearances</strong></span></h3><p>Reed has also been secretive regarding his height, weight, and physique measurements. Similarly, he hardly clicks images and enters the media. As a result, predicting his physical structure is quite tricky, but he has brown hair and eyes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Net_Worth><strong>Net Worth</strong></span></h3><p>Reed Paul’s father died of cancer in 2011 and was a billionaire. Reed’s father’s net worth was reported to be approximately $10.2 billion when he died. Reed’s mother, Laurene Powell Jobs, received all the fortunes following his death. Laurene inherited Steve’s wealth and has a net worth of $19.5 billion. She received billions of dollars in Apple and Disney shares from her late husband. However, she hasn’t given that money to her children because she wants them to earn it as their own. So, Reed’s net worth is not provided yet.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Social_Media><strong>Social Media</strong></span></h3><p>Reed, despite his popularity, avoids social media altogether. As a result, Reed Paul does not have any official Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or other social media profiles. Reed has been maintaining a tranquil life. He has not been seen on the Wiki page since, but his father and mother have it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Trivia><strong>Trivia</strong></span></h3><ul><li>Reed is the only son of his late father, Steve Jobs, from his previous relationships until his death.</li><li>Reed attended Hillsborough, California’s Crystal Springs Upland School.</li><li>Reed was always a quiet boy and had the impression of his mother, according to his father’s conversation with Issac, the author of Steve’s book, after his death.</li><li>Reed was named after his father, Steve, who spent a semester at Reed College.</li><li>He lives with his mother and two siblings in Palo Alto, California.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></h3><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Reed Paul Jobs?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Reed Paul Jobs is the son of the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>When was Reed Paul Jobs born?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Reed Paul Jobs was born on September 22, 1991.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>What is Reed Paul Jobs’ relationship to Steve Jobs?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Reed Paul Jobs is the biological son of Steve Jobs and is one of his four children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHBqJ2boZ9jsLC5jqucnpxdpa62uI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-yesenia-vega-kitt-new-york-pastry-chef-slammed-for-anti-semitic-remarks-692991-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Yesenia Vega-Kitt?
