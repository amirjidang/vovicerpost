They were “always kissing and dancing together,” per the source.</p><p>Tatum, 43, and Kravitz, 34, attended <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>’s <a href=#>Halloween</a> party in Los Angeles on Saturday, October 28. The pair got creative with their costumes, which were inspired by the film <a href=#>Rosemary’s Baby</a>. Kravitz dressed as the main character from the 1986 horror film, Rosemary Woodhouse, who is played by <a href=#><strong>Mia Farrow</strong></a>. She rocked a blonde pixie cut hairdo and a long white nightgown while holding a knife. Tatum, for his part, was the titular baby in a blue onesie and white bonnet.</p><p>Speculation arose after the party that <a href=#>the duo were engaged</a> as Kravitz was spotted wearing a ring on her left hand along with her costume.</p><p>Us confirmed in August 2021 that Kravitz and Tatum <a href=#>started dating</a> after collaborating on her directorial debut, Pussy Island. At the time, a source told Us that “things turned romantic fast” for the couple after “working together so closely.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Channing-Tatum-and-Zoe-Kravitz-Celebrate-Their-Engagement-in-%E2%80%98Amazing-Spirits2.jpg><p>“They both thought the other was cool, fun and attractive, but never acted on it because they were never single,” the insider shared. “They both have a lot in common, they’re both very active and love outdoor sports and being outdoors. They both work in Hollywood, but like being off the grid too, that’s why the [recent] upstate getaway was so great for them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before her relationship with Tatum, Kravitz was married to <a href=#><strong>Karl Glusman</strong></a>. The twosome split in December 2020 after 19 months of marriage, and <a href=#>their divorce was finalized</a> in August 2021. Tatum, for his part, was married to<a href=#><strong> Jenna Dewan</strong></a> — with whom he shares <a href=#>10-year-old daughter Everly</a> — from 2009 to 2019.</p><p>While Kravitz and Tatum have kept their romance low-key, the Batman star opened up about her connection with her now-fiancé in a November 2022 interview with GQ.</p><p>“He’s just a wonderful human,” she told the outlet. “He makes me laugh and we both really love art and talking about art and the exploration of why we do what we do. We love to watch a film and break it down and talk about it and challenge each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJGju6q6xmarmqylonq7u8RmoquZpp7Bu3nAq5xmoZ5irq6t2aKloGWjpbaztdOsZJqepJq%2FbrHNoJignZ2au7V7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-wootton-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-69932-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dan Wootton Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrities-that-are-christian.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrities That Are Christian Faith and Fame</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
