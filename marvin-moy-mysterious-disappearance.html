Prosecutors have suggested that Moy may have staged his own disappearance, leading a judge to issue a bench warrant for his arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>The exact circumstances of Moy’s disappearance remain uncertain, with some speculating that he may have faked the accident and fled.</p><p>After the Coast Guard rescued Max Wong from the ocean, he told them that their boat had been struck by a larger vessel and he had last seen Moy alive.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite an extensive search, Moy was not found, and the search was suspended a few days later. In a court hearing, a prosecutor requested a bench warrant for Moy’s arrest, suggesting that he may have fled rather than being deceased.&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of evidence in the case has led to ongoing suspicions about Moy’s disappearance, with the US attorney’s office continuing to investigate the case.</p><p>However, those with knowledge of Moy’s boating habits and skills believe they know what happened on the night of the incident.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York Times</a>, Dr. Marvin Moy was a Manhattan doctor who was facing legal issues before his disappearance at sea in October.</p><p>He was accused of bribing first responders and hospital employees to send car crash victims to his practice for pain <a href=#>management</a>. He was also in the midst of a contentious divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>On October 12, Moy went on a fishing trip off the coast of Long Island with a nurse named Max Wong. The next day, rescuers responding to the boat’s emergency beacon found debris and an oil slick and rescued Wong from the water. Moy was not found.&nbsp;</p><p>Wong claimed that they had been hit by another boat, and both were thrown into the ocean. However, prosecutors have suggested that Moy may have staged his own disappearance and was possibly never even on the boat.&nbsp;</p><p>A judge issued a bench warrant for Moy’s arrest, but he remains missing, and the exact circumstances of his disappearance remain unclear. The investigation into his disappearance is ongoing.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5wKutoqZdory6ecyyqq2dop68tr%2BMnaCsmaClsqK%2BwKeanmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-ethan-hawke-known-for-who-is-father.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ethan Hawke Became An Actor Because He Didn't Believe His Father Loved Him</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./douglas-hsu-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Douglas Hsu Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
