The show, which follows the hilarious lives of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and everyone in between, has been a household staple for as long as we can remember. Whether you are a lifelong fan of the show, or simply enjoy watching it now and again, there is no denying just how great of a cartoon "The Simpsons" truly is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering the show has been on-air for nearly four decades, fans are always curious to know more about the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> voices behind their favorite characters</a>. As for Bart Simpson, the incredible <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy Cartwright</a> has been voicing him for nearly 700 episodes! The star has been with the show since its start and has made quite a fortune doing what she is so great at. With that being said, here is everything we know about Nancy Cartwrights' impressive "Simpsons" salary.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Simpsons: How Seth Rogen And Other Celebs Have Influenced The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=the-voice-of-bart-simpson>The Voice Of Bart Simpson</h2><p>Nancy Cartwright voices one of "The Simpsons" most loved characters, Bart Simpson! The actress and voice-over artist has been part of the show since the very beginning. While voicing the same character for over 30 years might get tiring for some, Nancy has loved every minute of it, and who wouldn't when you are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being paid $300,000 per episode.</a> This impressive salary is known to be the set salary for all main voice actors, which ultimately comes up to about $7 million per season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This line of work has not only allowed Nancy to make a name for herself but amass a whopping net worth of $80 million! While we know and love Nancy as the voice of Bart Simpson, the star also voices a number of other characters from the show too! Cartwright is also behind the voices of Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, Kearney, and Database! Considering Nancy has taken on the role of voicing over six characters for the show, she has certainly earned every single penny she's made.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Most Simpsons Fans Don't Know About Springfield</a></span></p><p>While a net worth that massive is quite the feat, Nancy didn't make it all doing voice work. She has also appeared in a number of television shows and films over the course of her career. A few films that many may recognize Nancy from include "A Good Life", "Flesh + Blood" and "Godzilla". In addition to her work on-screen, Nancy Cartwright also wrote a book titled "My Life As A 10-Year-Old Boy", poking fun at the fact that she has been playing Bart Simpson for so long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she may be worth millions,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Nancy knows how to treat her fans!</a> The star ran into a 13-year-old student selling chocolate outside of a Macy's department store for a school fundraiser. While the boy had no clue who Nancy was, she quickly put on the Bart Simpson voice and 13-year-old James knew exactly who he was talking to. She purchased 10 chocolate bars and later signed a "Simpsons" card for him, too. If there is someone in the business who is doing things right, it is certainly Nancy Cartwright!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>'Good Morning America' Gives A BTS Look At The Voice Casting Of Lisa Simpson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lpJ2ybr%2FIpqesp56oerTAwKtkp5memMZur8Crq7CqmZy1tXnEmqmnZZakv27CzqKaoqaXYq%2BivtNmqqKloKi8r3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-anabelle-acosta-dating-anyone-what-is-her-relationship-with-shemar-moore-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Anabelle Acosta Dating Anyone, What Is Her Relationship With Shemar Moore?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heather-rae-young-tarek-el-moussas-kids-relationship-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Does Heather Rae Young Really Feel About Tarek El Moussa's Kids?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
