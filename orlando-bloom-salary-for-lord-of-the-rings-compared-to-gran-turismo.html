However, the film did so much more for his career, and it helped to put the star on the map. Bloom will never forget the moment his career changed after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was spotted by a fan grocery shopping for pasta</a>. Bloom still recalls the moment and although it was memorable, it was also kind of bizarre and odd at the same time given the way it went down.</p><p>"The first time that happened to me where I was recognized by somebody, yeah it was when I was like 23 or 22 or something. But I was walking through a supermarket, and I'd done some press and stuff... And this woman came up behind me and [LOTR] had only just released and she whispered into my ear, 'Are you my elf?"</p><p>He continues with Cinema Blend, "I was like, 'No, I'm your garden gnome?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Katy Perry & Orlando Bloom Pack On The PDA In St. Tropez While Their Wedding Remains Up In The Air</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bloom was honest about his pay in public, even telling the likes of Howard Stern that he didn't make much for Lord of the Rings.

And you’d do it again for half the money.”</p><p>That was Bloom's reveal about his salary for The Lord of the Rings. However, it didn't discourage the actor in the slightest, who had a heck of a run during his 20s. Nowadays in his 40s, Bloom is making big bucks, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly earning $700,000 for Gran Turismo</a>, while co-star David Harbour made $1.2 million, according FlickOnClick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Beatles Wanted To Make A Lord Of The Rings Musical, But Were Turned Down By An Iconic Director</a></span></p><p>As far as his career goes, this is a major step up for Orlando Bloom.

Speaking alongside Koimoi,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloom discussed the process behind the scenes</a>.</p><p>“One of the things that surprised me during the making of the movie is there’s so much glamour in what you see of the racing world,” said the actor.</p><p>He continues, "But actually, what goes into it, the dedication, the focus, the excellence for all of the team members and not just the drivers. That’s something that we explore in the movie. It is a very passionate movie, it is a very fast-paced action movie but at its core is a beautiful heartfelt story and a true story at that, which is what I think will keep people coming back for more.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of both the reviews and numbers, the film is off to an excellent start, overcoming big competition and surpassing Barbie. The film earned $17.3 million, making it quite the debut. That number will only continue to rise moving forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimq6SRo7GwecGlpqilXaiura3RsmSfp6JiubC%2Bw2amn2WknbJuvsinnqxlk6S6sa3RnptmrJ9itLOtzWarrqqZqLqwew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./outsourcing-affiliate-marketers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Outsourcing for Affiliate Marketers: 3 Focus Areas to Consider</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julie-bowen-helped-modern-family-costar-sarah-hyland-get-out-of-an-abusive-relationship.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Modern Familys Julie Bowen Helped Sarah Hyland Leave Abusive Relationship</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
