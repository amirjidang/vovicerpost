answers.</p><p>The community is in mourning over the recent tragic deaths of a family of four in what investigators believe to be a murder-suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>Police found the family after receiving a welfare check call from a concerned resident who had been locked out of the property.&nbsp;</p><p>The news of this devastating event has left community members shocked and grappling with their grief.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Allen TX Family Death</h2><p>On Monday morning, police were called to the 1200 block of Aberdeen Drive to check on the welfare of a family who had not been seen or heard from in several hours.&nbsp;</p><p>After other family members arrived at the property, police were able to enter the home and found the bodies of four individuals inside.&nbsp;</p><p>The deceased have not yet been identified, however, it has been revealed that the family consisted of a husband, wife, and their two sons aged 12 and two.&nbsp;</p><p>The community is devastated by this loss and is coming together to support one another during this difficult time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to the Family?</h2><p>The Islamic Association of Allen confirmed that the family was part of the Muslim community and that the father, mother, and two sons were found deceased inside the home.&nbsp;</p><p>The family had recently buried their 4-year-old daughter three weeks prior, who had died in a drowning accident at a pool.&nbsp;</p><p>The circumstances surrounding the family’s deaths remain unclear, with investigations ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p>Allen ISD also sent a letter to parents of Olson Elementary, where one of the children attended, informing them of the unexpected death of a fifth-grader with grief counselors available.&nbsp;</p><p>This tragic event has shaken the community to its core, mainly since a similar murder-suicide case occurred earlier in the year, where six family members were killed in a similar way.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Investigation</h2><p>The investigation into the deaths of the family members is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p>The police released limited information the following day, providing few details and refraining from confirming the identities or ages of the deceased.&nbsp;</p><p>However, they did indicate that the deaths appeared to be a result of a murder-suicide.</p><p>The investigation is expected to take some time as investigators piece together the events leading up to the tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the Islamic Association of Allen has partnered with the Muslim Association of Psychological Services to provide outreach to the community.&nbsp;</p><p>They also hosted a “Healing Circle,” providing counselors to help community members grapple with their grief.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Community Responses</h2><p>The Allen TX community is coming together to mourn the loss of the family and support one another during this difficult time.</p><p>The Islamic Association of Allen held a funeral, for the family on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p>Imam Abdul Rahman Bashir, the religious director for the Islamic Association of Allen, expressed his sorrow and the heavy impact on the community when a four-member family suddenly passed away.&nbsp;</p><p>As a father of three children himself, Imam Bashir understands the difficulty in comprehending the gravity of this situation and empathizes with the family’s struggles.&nbsp;</p><p>He encourages the community to support one another during this time of grief and emphasizes the importance of treasuring loved ones and recognizing life’s uncertainties.</p><p>The community is grappling with their grief over this devastating event and organizations such as MAPS have been working with them to ensure everyone has access to grief counseling services.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, other locals stated they’re willing to reach out to whoever may need assistance.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger
