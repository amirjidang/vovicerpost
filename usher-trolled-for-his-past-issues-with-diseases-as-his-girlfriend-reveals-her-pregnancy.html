His diseases took the spotlight in 2018 when multiple women accused him of knowingly spreading the herpes virus to them, in spite of being aware of his health issue.</p><p>That little reminder made everyone look at his girlfriend's new pregnancy just a tad bit differently...</p><h2 id=usher-s-dirty-past>Usher's Dirty Past</h2><p>Ushers dirty laundry is being aired once again, as fans refuse to let the world forget he was responsible for infecting many women with STD's in 2018. At that time, the world took notice of his overly active extra-curricular activities as&nbsp;one lady after another surfaced to say that they, too, contracted diseases after being intimate with Usher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, he was dragged for his complete disregard for the safety of others, as he freely engaged in intimate relationships with them in spite of knowing he would be infecting them.</p><p>Jennifer Goicoechea seems ok with it all though, since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's having another child with him.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber Shares BTS Studio Session With Usher</a></span></p><h2 id=usher-gets-dragged>Usher Gets Dragged</h2><p>Usher just can't shake his past.

Comments to this point included; "Y’all just keep getting pregnant by these burning men 🥴." and "Dont he still be itching and burning?"</p><p>Others said; "With or without the itching or burning? Just answer the question usher" while another person wrote; "So you just gone let it burn....." as well as; "So she burning too orrrrr?"</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Usher Amassed His Reported $200 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGisrKCVp3q1vs6lo56cXZu8s3nHoqpmqJGowW610qysnqtdrLa1tIydoKydkaiytHnArGShoaNitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqzsdWemKWrXZ2ys3nPq5ygppGjsLp7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vanderpump-rules-stars-who-left-the-series-where-are-they-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vanderpump Rules' Stars Who Left the Series: Where Are They Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-highest-grossing-don-cheadle-movies-ranked.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Highest-Grossing Don Cheadle Movies, Ranked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
