But with her podcast, "Broad Ideas With Rachel Bilson & Olivia Allen", the Hart of Dixie star has been far more open in recent years. This includes <a href=#>details about her brutal breakup with Bill Hader</a>.</p><p>But so little is known about the lengthiest and, arguably, most important relationship in her life. This would be her thing with <a href=#>Star Wars</a> actor, Hayden Christensen. Not only was she <strong>with Christensen for 11 years</strong>, but the two <strong>had a daughter together.</strong> Yet, fans are still curious about why their relationships deteriorated. But during a December 2023 interview with Bill Maher, Bilson revealed more than she ever has about why she and Christensen split up...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rachel-bilson-shed-light-on-why-she-and-hayden-christensen-broke-up-while-on-bill-maher-39-s-podcast>Rachel Bilson Shed Light On Why She And Hayden Christensen Broke Up While On Bill Maher's Podcast</h2><p>Bill Maher seems to have an uncanny ability to get his podcast guests to reveal extremely personal details about their lives. Part of it is clearly due to the format of his podcast, "Club Random". Unlike <strong>his HBO show, Real Time With Bill Maher</strong>, "Club Random" doesn't have to move from segment to segment or deal with multiple guests. Additionally, it doesn't have to stick to politics. The entire concept of Bill Maher's "Club Random" is that it's just a free-flowing hangout... One with weed and alcohol that helps to loosen lips.</p><p>But it was Maher's honest conversation about relationships and marriage that may have caused Rachel Bilson to reveal details about her mysterious breakup with Star Wars' Hayden Christensen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rachel-bilson-revealed-why-her-relationship-with-hayden-christensen-ended-during-an-interview-with-bill-maher-front-deposit-back-bill-maher-_-youtube.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So, why did your marriage not work?" Bill Maher asked Bilson during<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> their interview on his podcast on December 17th, 2023.</a></p><p>"I was never married," Bilson corrected. "[You mean my] longterm?"</p><p>"I mean, it must have been long if you had a kid," Maher said.</p><p>"It was 11 years."</p><p>"11 years! Oh, well," Maher said shocked. This was right after <a href=#>he spilled his relationship secrets to Bilson</a>, including how he hadn't been in a relationship for more than 5 years. "That's probably the average of what a marriage lasts."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/rachel-bilson-got-bill-maher-to-reveal-the-truth-about-his-relationships-during-an-interview-front-back_deposit-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later in the interview, Bill Maher attempted to get Rachel Bilson to reveal more about why her 11-year romance with the Star Wars actor came to an end. While she tried to explain the reasoning for her breakup with Hayden Christensen, it was clear she was trying to avoid the gruesome details.</p><p>"Time... you know... things happen. Things change. It was difficult... There were many difficult things..."</p><p>"But why the secret?" Maher pressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bilson then admitted that she and Christensen separated for a brief period before their breakup. According to her, this occurred early on in their relationship. While continuing to evade the details, Bilson continued to shed more light on the reason for why she and Christensen ended things:</p><p>"There was a like a little separation a little earlier on, and then back together, and then having a kid. And then, you know, just different... [Hayden] was from a different place and like, wanted to spend more time there. And just like sometimes things just don't jell... That's all I will say.

Their on-screen romantic chemistry quickly turned to one off-screen. Their relationship moved so swiftly that the pair actually <strong>got engaged less than a year later</strong>. Their romance followed Bilson's three-year thing with her O.C. co-star, Adam Brody. But Christensen and Bilson didn't rush to have a wedding. Instead, they stayed engaged until 2010, when they ended up calling it off.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Rachel Bilson's Relationship History</strong></p></td><td><p>According To Us Weekly</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Adam Brody</p></td><td><p>2003 - 2006</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hayden Christensen</p></td><td><p>2007 - 2017</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bill Hader</p></td><td><p>2019 - 2020</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zac LaRoc</p></td><td><p>2021 -</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to In Style, Rachel Bilson and Hayden Christensen actually broke up in 2010.

Briar Rose Christensen became the focal point of their relationship until <strong>calling it quits once again in 2017.</strong> But this time, it was for good.</p><p>Neither star ever publicly commented on the reason for the breakup, according to In Style. This left fans guessing at what really went on behind the scenes. The only thing they had to go on was what unconfirmed sources were telling the tabloids. This includes the physical separation they endured as well as the rumor that Christensen was far more introverted and antisocial than Bilson was, thus driving a wedge between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/why-hayden-christensen-s-ex-rachel-bilson-wants-to-hide-star-wars-from-their-daughter.jpg><p>Another source stated that Bilson and Christensen bickered about basically everything, mostly small, daily things that couples should be in sync about.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rachel-bilson.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Rachel Bilson And Bachelor Nations' Nick Viall Once Trolled The Whole Internet, Here's How</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Rachel Bilson and Nick Viall were linked together after exchanging flirty comments in 2019.</span><p>In 2021, Rachel Bilson shed a bit more light on her relationship with Hayden Christensen.
