Although the Transformers films made big bucks and spawned four sequels it was panned by the critics. Battleship never got off the ground, despite a memorable appearance by <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a></strong>. For every flop there is a LEGO Movie, which was loved by fans and critics alike, so we're not surprised Hollywood wants to make more films based on our beloved childhood toys.It felt like only a matter of time that Barbie should finally get her live-action due. The Barbie movie has been in development for years, with the likes of Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer attached to play the iconic blonde.The film finally looks like it has a cast and will make it into production. Directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie, there is a lot to be excited about when it comes to the new Barbie film. Here is everything we know:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=originally-set-to-star-amy-schumer><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Originally Set To Star Amy Schumer</span></h2><p>This live-action Barbie film has been in the works since 2014. A number of actresses have been in talks for the lead role and linked to the blonde doll in the media. Initially, it was commissioned by Sony and was set to be written by Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody and actress Amy Schumer was set to play Barbie.</p><p>Although at the time it was reported to have been scheduling conflicts that led to her leaving the film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has recently revealed that it was creative difference that forced her to leave the role.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[The studio] definitely didn’t want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,” Schumer says in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. She then goes on to explain that, she and co-writer Kim Caramele wanted Barbie to be an “ambitious inventor.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Say Amy Schumer's Critics Hate Her For Three Reasons">Fans Say Amy Schumer's Critics Hate Her For Three Reasons</a></span></p><p>“The idea that that’s just what every woman must want, right there, I should have gone, ‘You’ve got the wrong gal,’” Schumer reveals.</p><p>When Schumer pulled out in 2016, Anne Hathaway was rumored to have filled her shoes.

Considering her LuckyChap production company helped make movies like Promising Young Woman and I,Tonya we're expecting something a bit different from this Robbie-led vehicle.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a December 2020 interview with The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Robbie revealed some information about the role. "We like the things that feel a little left of center. Something like Barbie where the IP, the name itself, people immediately have an idea of, 'Oh, Margot is playing Barbie, I know what that is,' but our goal is to be like, 'Whatever you're thinking, we're going to give you something totally different — the thing you didn't know you wanted."</p><h2 id=ryan-gosling-will-play-ken-in-barbie><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ryan Gosling Will Play Ken In 'Barbie'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was announced last year that <a href=#>Ryan Gosling will be starring as Barbie's boyfriend, Ken</a>.
