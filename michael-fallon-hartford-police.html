style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Michael Fallon Hartford Police has been embroiled in controversy due to his involvement in falsifying traffic reports.</p><p>Former Hartford police officer Michael Fallon resigned in March 2023 after admitting to falsifying 33 traffic reports over two years.&nbsp;</p><p>The discrepancies were discovered during a routine audit, which found that Fallon had over-reported traffic stops and inaccurately reported the gender and race of those involved.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, a traffic stop related to an arrest warrant was falsely reported.</p><p>Fallon’s internal affairs investigation revealed that he had purposely lied on activity reports to embellish his activities over a four-week period in late 2022 to early 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>He did so because he did not want to disappoint his supervisors with limited activity.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his dishonesty violated the Hartford Police Department’s strict no-tolerance policy for such conduct, and the department took swift and immediate action after substantiating the misconduct.</p><p>Fallon’s late father’s status as the former assistant chief of the Hartford Police Department adds another layer of significance to this case.&nbsp;</p><p>The department has started ensuring that Fallon is decertified from being a police officer anywhere else.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Like the Connecticut State Troopers, Hartford cops are liars, too. | "between Jan. 2, 2022, and Dec. 31, 2022, Officer Michael Fallon reported 575 motor vehicle stops when he made 347 and said he issued 31 infractions more than he did." <a href=#>https://t.co/rvLtIiS7tV</a></p>— nobody from nowhere (@OLAASM) <a href=#>August 24, 2023</a></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Investigation reveals Falsification of reports by Michael Fallon</h2><p>Revelations regarding Fallon’s investigation emerged on Thursday during a Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project board meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>This initiative scrutinizes traffic stop data from all state police departments.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hartford police initiated an inquiry, leading to the subsequent release of the department’s investigation findings.</p><p>These findings revealed discrepancies between Officer Fallon’s reported traffic stops and the department’s record management system.&nbsp;</p><p>While Fallon claimed to have conducted 575 stops, records showed only 380 stops.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Fallon reported issuing 281 traffic infractions, but the investigation found evidence of only 250.&nbsp;</p><p>Investigators also discovered that Fallon submitted forms for 33 non-existent traffic stops, which were sent for traffic analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, allegations were made regarding Fallon’s failure to activate his body camera when required and errors in his reports.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Municipal and Regional Policy at UConn</h2><p>One key institution that played a role in investigating Michael Fallon’s traffic report falsifications is the Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy at UConn.&nbsp;</p><p>Associate Director Ken Barone reported that the organization’s investigation concluded that Fallon had falsified at least 33 racial profiling records.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Barone added that there is no concern from the project staff’s perspective that this issue is more widespread in Hartford.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Fallon Hartford Police Dishonesty</h2><p>Fallon’s falsification of traffic reports has affected his career and the public perception of the Hartford Police Department.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that one of its officers purposely lied on official reports can undermine citizens’ trust in the department’s ability to enforce the law and serve justice effectively.</p><p>Ivelisse Correa, Legislative Policy Director and Vice President of BLM 860, expressed disappointment in Fallon’s actions.&nbsp;</p><p>She remarked that, as taxpayers, citizens should be able to trust the people they hire and pay. She hopes that others will heed the warning that Fallon’s case sends.</p><p>In a statement, Chief Jason Thody emphasized that such conduct has no place in the Hartford Police Department.&nbsp;</p><p>He clarified that the department’s process worked precisely as it should, identifying discrepancies, initiating an investigation, and taking swift and suitable action when misconduct was substantiated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Consequences for Fallon’s Actions</h2><p>Michael Fallon’s falsification of traffic reports carries significant consequences for him and his former department.</p><p>&nbsp;Violating the department’s policy could harm his chances of pursuing a law enforcement career.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the Hartford Police Department’s reputation could be negatively impacted, it could take time to regain the public’s trust.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moving forward</h2><p>Michael Fallon’s falsification of traffic reports has resulted in severe consequences for him, his late father’s legacy, and the Hartford Police Department.&nbsp;</p><p>The department’s investigation uncovered a clear violation of its strict zero-tolerance policy for such misconduct.&nbsp;</p><p>Fallon’s case also underscores the crucial role of public trust in law enforcement in effectively preventing and addressing crime.&nbsp;</p><p>To demonstrate its dedication to justice and transparency, the department has taken significant measures by cutting ties with Fallon and seeking to prevent his future employment as a police officer.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5yJyfmp2cYrOiuMuopWagkafBp7vRnWSpp5yesKZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nikki-mccray-net-worth-at-time-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nikki McCray net worth at time of death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-carter-reum-paris-hiltons-multi-millionaire-husband.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Carter Reum: Paris Hilton's Multi-Millionaire Husband</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
