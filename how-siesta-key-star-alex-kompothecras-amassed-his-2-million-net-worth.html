Along the lines of Laguna Beach (and other such reality tv shows), Siesta Key has had a handful of seasons on MTV. It’s also got a huge cult following, even if many of us don’t come out and admit it right away. After all, it’s not like it’s 90 Day Fiancé. There isn’t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a million spin-offs</a>, and the stars on Siesta Key don’t necessarily get <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the social media numbers</a> that other celebrities do. You wouldn’t find Keeping Up With The Kardashians<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on the same planet </a>as Siesta Key. But does that make it any less of a reality show? Can the members of Siesta join the other reality gods that grace our tv guide pages? We believe that the answer is yes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Take, for instance, Alex Kompothecras. While we’ll get into some of his problematic behavior, you can’t deny the fact that the guy has a high net worth. $2 million of a net worth, to be exact. That’s the kind of number that only comes from hard work on reality tv. But he has amassed it through other means as well. And it might not last forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alex-kompo-and-girlfriend.jpg><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How 'RHONJ' Star Jackie Goldschneider Is Adding To Her $2 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-built-it-up-with-a-little-help>He Built It Up With A Little Help</h2><p>Siesta Key as a show was inspired by Laguna Beach. But how did it happen in the first place? Coming out of nowhere in 2017, this show has since existed for three seasons (and gotten consistent viewership since the beginning). Kompothecras has been on it<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> since the beginning</a>, and it’s no secret as to why. His father helped to film the pilot, and we’re willing to bet is still throwing a little extra cash towards it to this day. While we like to think “Kompo” got his starring role through impartial means, it’s more likely that he got it because of his dad being so involved. This means he has his dad to thank for his net worth. The reality star has amassed a $2 million net worth, and it seems to all be coming from Siesta Key. While other stars usually have a laundry list of investments, properties, and side gigs, Kompothecras doesn’t have those. He seems to have Siesta Key, and some net worth on behalf of his dad’s empire as well. And we have to say, it’s not the most reliable source either. This is because one misstep can take away someone’s role in a reality tv show. We’ll explain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alex-kompothecras.jpg><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Biggest Celebrity Cancellations Of The Last Decade</a></span></p><h2 id=nothing-lasts-forever>Nothing Lasts Forever</h2><p>Words matter, even if they are online. Social media does a great job of both concealing and revealing people, including Alex Kompothecras. And we need to take a look at some of the issues surrounding Kompothecras’s online presence. While nobody is ever going to call reality stars the pinnacle of understanding and sensitivity, they do need to know the basics. Like, for instance, don’t perpetuate hatred and prejudices involving race, romantic orientation, or gender identity. You’d think anyone would be able to agree with that, but unfortunately, some people can’t help themselves. Where does Kompothecras come into this, and why are we talking about it? Well, it actually seems to have a bearing on his net worth. We didn’t want to believe that Kompothecras was like that, but sure enough, he engaged in a series of comments on posts using incredibly bad language, most of which centered around a slur which Kompothecras should absolutely never use. We won’t get into too many details because it can be quite triggering for people, but know that it wasn’t appropriate at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alex-kompo.jpg><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Reality Stars Who Got Themselves Fired</a></span></p><p>Rightfully, MTV<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> decided to pull him from the show</a>. They’ve gone so far as to edit him out post-filming, even. Not every storyline involved him, but enough did that this is probably going to impact the season. It’s worth it though, as MTV is currently trying to take a stronger stance against stars that they’ve caught engaging in inappropriate, hurtful acts online and in person. They posted to their social media, “we’ve made the decision to cut ties with Alex and are editing the current season to minimize his presence. He will not be in future seasons of Siesta Key.” While they don’t out and out explain that it’s because of the comments, it’s totally because of the comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kompo and his father might be looking for a solution to this unjust choice, but in our eyes, they need to sit down. MTV made the correct choice. Alex Kompothecras might want to start looking at re-enrolling in law school, is our suggestion. That’s one way to keep his net worth up now that he’s no longer engaged with Siesta Key. Although, money can speak louder than words on social media; he might as of yet get his dad to pull some strings and get him back on the show.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How 'Teen Mom 2' Cast Member Briana Dejesus Amassed Her Six-Figure Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqLamv9OaZKSdqWLAta3RZpilnahiuLC5z6iroZ2Tp660ecCmmKyrlZl6qbXSZmlmpZmhuaq7zWalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-michael-mccary-make-latest-michael-mccary-net-worth-income-salary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Michael McCary Make?
