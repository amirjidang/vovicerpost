Their son, James, joined Harrison on the field after the <a href=# rel=noopener>team’s 2020 win</a>, while his daughter, whose name and birthday have not been revealed, enjoyed the celebrations in 2023.</p><p>Scroll down to see Harrison and Isabelle’s love story from the beginning:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kansas-City-Chief-s-Kicker-Harrison-Butker-and-Wife-Isabelle-s-Relationship-Timeline-4.jpg><h3><strong>April 2013</strong></h3><p>The couple began dating in high school, which culminated with the pair going to prom together their senior year.</p><h3><strong>January 2014</strong></h3><p>Harrison revealed <a href=# rel=noopener>via Instagram</a> that he and Isabelle had been together “almost four years” when he visited her in Memphis at college. Harrison, for his part, played football at Georgia Tech from 2013 to 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kansas-City-Chiefs-Kicker-Harrison-Butker-and-Wife-Isabelle-s-Relationship-Timeline-3.jpg><h3><strong>May 2017</strong></h3><p>Harrison proposed to Isabelle one month after he was drafted into the NFL by the Carolina Panthers. He was signed to the Chiefs in September of that year.</p><p>“After almost 7 years of being best friends with this girl, I finally popped the question. From the first moments of our relationship, back in freshman year of high school, I always envisioned marrying you and raising a family together,” Harrison <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote via Instagram</a> alongside photos from the engagement, which took place on a football practice field. “You push me to be a better man and are so patient and forgiving when I fall short. I am truly amazed at how God has worked in your life and in our relationship and pray we continue to learn and grow from each other. Can’t wait to see what our future holds together as a married couple! I love you Izzy.”</p><h3><strong>April 2018</strong></h3><p>The pair tied the knot less than one year after getting engaged. “I will continue to pray for the strength and perseverance to sacrifice for you every day of our marriage,” the NFL player wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>via Instagram</a> after saying “I do” during a Catholic service. “We have finally entered into the unbreakable union of the marital bond, and I am overjoyed to begin our lives together. I love you Izzy! Our Lady of Lourdes, Pray for us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kansas-City-Chief-s-Kicker-Harrison-Butker-and-Wife-Isabelle-s-Relationship-Timeline-5.jpg><h3><strong>January 2019</strong></h3><p>Harrison announced the birth of his son, James Augustine Butker, via X.</p><h3><strong>January 2020</strong></h3><p>The athlete celebrated the Chiefs’ AFC Championship win at Arrowhead Stadium with his wife and son. The following month, he won his first Super Bowl ring with the team, and his family was by his side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kansas-City-Chief-s-Kicker-Harrison-Butker-and-Wife-Isabelle-s-Relationship-Timeline-6.jpg><h3><strong>January 2023</strong></h3><p>“When I come home from the facilities, I can’t think about football anymore. I’m in dad mode and husband mode,” Harrison said of his home life during an appearance on the “Kansas City Mom Collective” podcast.</p><p>He gave a little insight into his relationship with Isabelle, saying, “The one off day that we do have, I try to be very intentional with trying to plan some type of family get-together. We’ve been doing Tuesday evenings as our date night.”</p><h3><strong>February 2023</strong></h3><p>While the couple never publicly announced their daughter’s birth, the little girl was on hand with her big brother to celebrate Harrison’s second Super Bowl win.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kansas-City-Chief-s-Kicker-Harrison-Butker-and-Wife-Isabelle-s-Relationship-Timeline.jpg><h3><strong>May 2023</strong></h3><p>The football player spoke about the importance of love while giving a <a href=# rel=noopener>commencement speech</a> at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “This is the most important ring I have right here,” Harrison said while pointing to his wedding band. “My confidence as a husband and father, and yes, even as a football player is rooted in my marriage with my wife, as we leave our mark on future generations by the children we bring into the world. How much greater of a legacy can anyone leave than that?”</p><p>He added: “In the end, no matter how much money you attain, none of it will matter if you are alone and devoid of purpose. … I can offer one controversial antidote that I believe will have a lasting impact for generations to come: get married and start a family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJmas7R5yqKapJ2iYrWivtGiqqimXZfCtbfEq2SwoZaaeqq%2FwJucpaSVqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMraCmnZyeu6Z7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christy-carlson-romano-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christy Carlson Romano Net Worth How Much is Christy Carlson Romano Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cher.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cher Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
