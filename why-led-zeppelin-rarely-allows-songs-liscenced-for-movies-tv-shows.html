The album, which received commercial acclaim, introduced Zeppelin's sound to a global audience.

Like its predecessors, the album did very well on the charts and has become regarded as one of Led Zeppelin's greatest albums. In November 1971, the band released an untitled album, which as become known as "Led Zeppelin IV."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Featuring classics such as "Stairway to Heaven", "Rock and Roll", and "Black Dog", the album became the band's best-selling project.

Plant and Page, both perfectionists, poured their hearts and souls into Led Zeppelin's music during the band's active years and understood how important their work was to millions of fans around the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jimmy-page-led-zeppelin-book-launch.jpg><p>As time has gone on, Led Zeppelin has been more receptive to licensing their music. During the pre-production of the classic 2003 comedy School of Rock, Jack Black sent a plea video to Led Zeppelin asking for permission to use "Immigrant Song" in the movie. Knowing how the movie could introduce their work to a new generation, Plant, Page, and Jones gave their blessing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plant was glad they made the decision to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">let "Immigrant Song" be in School of Rock</a>. "So give it to the kids, it's great. I mean, Jack Black's got it down right," Plant explained. School of Rock was among the first blockbusters to sample Led Zeppelin's music in the 21st century. 1980s classic Fast Times at Ridgemont High featured "Kashmir", according to Screen Rant.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/robert-plant-has-a-specific-reason-for-being-skeptical-about-playing-led-zeppelin-s-stairway-to-heaven-despite-its-massive-appeal.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Robert Plant Has A Specific Reason For Being Skeptical About Playing Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven Despite Its Massive Appeal</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Robert Plant feels "overwhelmed" listening to the song, and is not a fan of performing it live.</span><p>Films such as Thor: Ragnarok, Argo, Arthur: Legend of the Sword, The Big Short, American Hustle, Shrek the Third, and Silver Linings Playbook have all featured a Led Zeppelin song.</p><p>While the band has been more willing to license their music, it has come with a price.
