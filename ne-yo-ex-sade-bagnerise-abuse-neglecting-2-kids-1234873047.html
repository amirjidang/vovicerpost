She has also accused the “Because of You” crooner of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234856349>engaging in drugs and alcohol</a> around their children.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In an Instagram Live video obtained by&nbsp;LiveBitez&nbsp;on April 25, Bagnerise could be seen and heard having a heated argument with the 44-year-old about their past and current issues — all while their young boys slept.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At one point in the exchange, she even called <a href=# id=auto-tag_ne-yo data-tag=ne-yo>Ne-Yo</a> “Diddy Jr.” for having women over while their children are present and also claimed that <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234836071>he had “freak-offs.”</a> She even went as far as accusing the star of “body slamming” her. However, she didn’t make it clear if the alleged assault had just happened or was from the past.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Tell them about the freak-off, Diddy Jr.,” she can be heard saying when the video begins. “You know what you did. You body-slammed me on the floor. Tell them the real you and why we’re here today?” She also continued to question why he “just can’t be at home with his kids.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You f**king like to have ho*s, drugs and weed, alcohol, mushrooms, and prostitutes in the house while your kids are here,” she said as Ne-Yo laughed her off. “Everyone has asked him to stop, but he will not listen to nobody. This is what’s going on. This is the tea… I even came over here to help him with these f**king kids because he won’t watch these kids.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Arkansas native can also be heard threatening to call the police on Bagnerise, who he said was disturbing the peace and refusing to leave his home.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Last year, Bagnerise publicly dished about her<a href=#> tumultuous co-parenting relationship</a> with Ne-Yo, who she claims has a sex addiction.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I keep on hearing and seeing all different sides in regards to his behavior & I’ve noticed TWO THINGS,” she wrote last June on her Instagram Story about the Grammy winner.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Everyone including his mother, associates, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234871711>myself, and Crystal </a>have all individually said and agree that NONE OF US can recognize this person he has become,” she wrote. “The company that he keeps, which is the primary reason for his demise and DIVORCE (before Crystal ever knew there was a me or kids) is straying him away from the gentle loving man he truly is at heart.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“They are encouraging his erratic and embarrassing behavior and [sex] addiction. This is like smoking around a junkie,” she continued. “They encourage the alcohol and drugs and outrageous and risky promiscuous lifestyle that may ultimately expose him to diseases he can’t ever get rid of. Unfortunately, he is in the company of users, groupies and bad influences who say yes to everything he says or does.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2024-04-25-at-10.31.12-AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Earlier this year, Ne-Yo was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234858650>spotted parading around&nbsp;Jamaica</a> with two women.
