The evolution of modern rap to what it is today can be considered the responsibility of the American rapper known as Future, who was born Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn. The rapper’s musical style birthed a new generation of rap artists and created a genre now named trap music. The American rapper, record producer, singer, and songwriter has risen to the summit of modern music with his genre of rap, topping music charts with each release. A notoriously hard worker, he has six studio albums to his name with several mixtapes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-future></span><strong>Who is Future?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>DeMun, who is professionally known as Future was born on November 20, 1983. His introduction to professional music started as a part of the Dungeon Family, a music collective based in Atlanta, Georgia. It was during his time in this collective that he earned his nickname, ‘the Future’. He would later adopt it as his stage name, dropping the article ‘the’.</p><p>Future was determined to become a successful musician after his first cousin and one of the leaders of Dungeon Family, Rico Wade advised him to pursue a career as a rapper. For this reason, his education was limited to the high school level, which he&nbsp;had at Columbia High School in Atlanta. He started to learn under Atlanta’s Rocko and was promptly signed to his A-1 Recordings label.</p><p>Since his determination to become a rapper, his work ethic skyrocketed and within a year from 2010-2011, he released several mixtapes. His music and his hard work earned him a recording contract with a major label at Epic Records in 2011. After signing his contract, he promptly released another mixtape which he titled Streetz Calling. The buzz from his mixtapes earned him a place on the XXL annual list of Rap Freshmen in 2012.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-american-rapper></span><strong>Everything You Need to Know About the American Rapper</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Future released his first studio album, Pluto on April 17, 2012, to mild positive reviews from critics. The album which featured several collaborations with established artists such as Drake, Snoop Dogg, and R. Kelly debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold five years after its release in 2017.</p><p>The musician released his second studio album, Honest on April 22, 2014. The album received a better critical success than its predecessor. It featured multiple artists such as Drake, Kanye West, Rihanna, and Ciara went straight up to number two on its release and was named in the Top 10 Best rap albums of 2014. Not one to rest on his laurels, the rapper released another album, DS2 less than a year later and it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.</p><p>In the same year 2015, Future took his collaborative music a step further and released a joint project with Drake titled ‘What a Time to Be Alive’. The mixtape debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and made Future the first rapper in 11 years to have two chart-topping albums in one year.</p><p>Future wasn’t stopping and in less than a year, he released another studio album, titled EVOL to another number one spot on the Billboard 200, becoming the fastest artist to have three number one albums on the Billboard 200.</p><p>His music style has been described as a clever use of the auto-tune to color his emotions. His style has drawn controversial comments from T-Pain, another popular user of the auto-tune for his unconventional use of the feature.</p><p>Future’s unconventional album release cycle continued in 2017 when he released his fifth and sixth studio albums within a week of each other, with both albums debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. The feat made the rapper the first artist to debut two albums at number one at the same time in the charts.</p><p>The rapper’s swift rise to stardom and his hard work, releasing multiple successful projects in a short career period has earned him a net worth of $50 million. He has sold out shows and tours along with several features by other artists due to his popularity which has given his financial status a rapid rise.</p><p>A man mostly focused on his music, Future’s controversies stem from his relationships. He was engaged to the singer, Ciara in a high profile relationship but it was broken off due to infidelity on Future’s part. The two share a son together. He also has 3 children from three different women named&nbsp;Prince Wilburn,&nbsp;Londyn Wilburn, and Future Zahir Wilburn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yfrK2topp6ornEq6CcmZ5iv6K8z56pZqCVp7K0ecSvnKuxpJ22r7OMsqauZZ6asqV506hkpKafrHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-irv-gikofsky-everything-to-know-about-the-weather-forecaster.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Irv Gikofsky?
