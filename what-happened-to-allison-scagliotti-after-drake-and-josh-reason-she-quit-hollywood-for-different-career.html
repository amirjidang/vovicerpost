She did keep acting after Drake & Josh's 2007 series finale. She played Abby Brown in three episodes of One Tree Hill in 2006 and 2007. She played Mindy Crenshaw again in the TV movie Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh. But she only had small roles on TV until she was cast in Warehouse 13 as Claudia Donovan. The show aired from 2009 to 2014.</p><p>However, besides playing Georgie Dowling in a few episodes of The Vampire Diaries, Scagliotti's most beloved role was definitely Mindy on Drake & Josh.

In May 2023, she posted a photo of herself holding a Joan Jett Signature Gibson guitar, which she had just sold on Reverb. She shared the good memories she has of this guitar and wrote in the caption, "I bought my very first electric guitar at 19 years old."</p><p>She continued, "I toted her all around the world with me. Through the snow to lessons in Toronto. To my Bowery apartment during my semester at NYU. Sprinting to catch my plane out of Heathrow after a trip to see Saul’s play. I played her in my teenage bedroom, at open mic nights, friends’ apartments, studio sessions for @lafemmependu, and @ultimatejamnight. To whoever just bought her on @reverb, I hope she brings you as much joy and inspiration as she brought me. Take good care of my first love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/allison-scagliotti-2.jpg><p>The actress began working toward her Interdisciplinary Music Studies degree at Berklee Online in 2015.</p><p>As she explained in an interview with Berklee Online, she took ballet classes when she was young and has always been a huge music person.
