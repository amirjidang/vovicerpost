He began his story providing context, but hilariously confused Swift with <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>. “Kanye West pulls up to Vegas,” Marshall said. “Kanye West buys a ticket right in front of Katy Perry’s booth, so any time they were going to be showing Katy Perry [on television,] Kanye’s face was going to be there.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He corrected himself and continued on with the story, saying, “He’s got a mask on with his logo on the mask — typical Kanye. Taylor Swift gets pissed off, she boom boom makes a call or two. Everybody’s involved. He gets kicked out the stadium!” The six-time Pro Bowler believed that Ye was looking to “leverage her celebrity” and one of his co-hosts agreed, saying that the NFL wouldn’t show the <a href=#>Vultures</a> artist on television on his own so by sitting in front of Swift, he could be seen every time she is shown.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As of now, no one else has chimed in to confirm Brandon Marshall’s story and some footage makes his story confusing. There are clips of Kanye West hanging out with his Vultures collaborator <a href=#>Ty Dolla $ign</a> and <a href=#>Anderson .Paak</a> in a suite.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A television in one of the videos shows that the game was in the third quarter while he was in the suite, so if he was “kicked out,” it could have happened early in the game. Perhaps he somehow found his way into a suite away from Taylor Swift or he was fully removed from Allegiant Stadium late in the game. Either way, while Marshall’s story is a bit funny, the proof of Ye’s presence at Allegiant makes everything conflicting.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Good Life” artist’s presence was felt on Super Bowl Sunday via a <a href=#>commercial for Yeezy.com</a>. The polarizing artist appeared in the back of the car in a grainy video that looked like it was recorded on his phone. He revealed that he spent all of his budget on the expensive Super Bowl ad spot, thus he was unable to put together a commercial as grandiose as they usually are. However, he still wanted people to go to Yeezy.com to get his shoes. Check out the commercial below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e%2ForrDqKVmpZGnwKmty6VkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXaCur8XEZq6eq6RiwLa8xKtkm6enoXpyfpJtb25pZG6EcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cameron-mathison-is-grateful-after-difficult-cancer-diagnosis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cameron Mathison Is 'Grateful' After 'Difficult' Cancer Diagnosis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./live-best-black-friday-deals-and-sales-2022-launch-now-live-find-updates-11-24.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Black Friday Deals Live Coverage: The 200+ Best Deals, So Far</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
