And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">maybe it was the promise of a solid paycheck</a> that lured her in, but fans really had to wonder -- why did Christie join the sitcom cast?</p><h2 id=how-did-christie-brinkley-end-up-on-parks-and-rec>How Did Christie Brinkley End Up On 'Parks And Rec'?</h2><p>The short answer is that Christie wound up on the show because she was invited to join the cast. There apparently wasn't an audition to go through or any other 'test' before Brinkley was brought on board.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To Ben Schwartz After 'Parks And Rec'?</a></span></p><p>In fact, the crew was apparently so shocked to even get the chance at nabbing Christie for the show that they didn't believe they really had her signed on at first. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The casting directors wanted "a Christie Brinkley type,"</a> they admitted, but no one thought&nbsp;the Christie would be willing to portray Jerry's wife.</p><p>They were shocked when she signed on, but they were also thrilled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=so-why-did-christie-brinkley-agree-to-appear-on-the-show>So Why Did Christie Brinkley Agree To Appear On The Show?</h2><p>Ultimately, it may not have been Brinkley's dream gig to play the gorgeous wife of the often-underestimated Jerry. But as it turns out, one person was dead-set on Christie becoming the TV wife the cast dreamed of: her daughter.</p><p>Christie's daughter Sailor "was a huge fan," per&nbsp;Howard Stern, and she always appeared on set with her mom when it was Brinkley's time to shoot.</p><p>In fact, Sailor "urged" her mom to say yes to the opportunity. So while it might not have earned her megabucks in comparison to other gigs, Christie likely agreed to the role to charm <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her daughter, who also happens to be a model</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then again, Brinkley has appeared on other sitcoms, too, so maybe this is a part-time hobby for the model and entrepreneur.&nbsp;Or maybe she just gets a kick out of her kids enjoying seeing her on shows like 'The Goldbergs.'</p><h2 id=what-is-christie-brinkley-doing-now>What Is Christie Brinkley Doing Now?</h2><p>Now that 'Parks and Recreation' has&nbsp;long since ended, does Christie have any other plans to appear on TV shows? Though she had a guest role on 'The Goldbergs' most recently, Christie doesn't seem too keen to appear on TV again; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her most recent role before that</a> was on 'Nightcap' in 2017.</p><p>Of course, she's stayed plenty busy, launching a Prosecco brand and lounging on the beach on holiday. In fact, her Instagram followers are constantly asking Christie where she is and how she's found such gorgeous beaches to sunbathe on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, her time as Gayle Gergich is closer to real-life than fans thought!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Lesser-Known Facts About Former Model, Christie Brinkley</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecKhqaKrpJ6ybq7RoqWkpJWuequ7yKdkqZmioMBurc2dZKudk2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-siesta-key-star-alex-kompothecras-amassed-his-2-million-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How 'Siesta Key' Star Alex Kompothecras Amassed His $2 Million Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./grant-shaffer-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-612625-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Grant Shaffer Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
