However, when it comes to celebrities, a lot of people who love gossip expect them to confirm any rumors about who they may be dating.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Breaks His Silence On His Love Life...Are The Rumors Real?</a></span>Since <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a> is one of the biggest movie stars of his generation, there have been a lot of rumors about him over the years. In some cases, that has meant that people have gossiped about <a href=#>stars Pitt won't work with again</a> and in others, it has been about <a href=#>famous women he has been linked to</a>.Most recently, there has been a rumor that Brad Pitt has been dating the famous model Emily Ratajkowski which is unconfirmed as of this writing. Whether or not it is true that Ratajkowski is involved with Pitt, that has left some observers wondering if she should have been involved with Pete Davidson instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rumors-about-brad-pitt-and-emily-ratajkowski>The Rumors About Brad Pitt And Emily Ratajkowski</h2><p>Over the last twenty years, Brad Pitt has been married to two massively successful women, <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> and Angelina Jolie. Unfortunately, both of those pairings that some people considered dream couples came to an end with scandalous divorces.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Did Angelina Jolie Think Of Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt's Relationship?</a></span></p><p>No matter how Brad Pitt's two marriages ended, he once again becomes one of the most eligible bachelors in the world anytime he becomes a single man.</p><p>Since a lot of people consider Brad Pitt to be so desirable, it isn't overly surprising that there have been some rumors about him dating different women. Still, when you look at the recent rumors about Pitt's love life, it is staggering to see how many ladies people once thought he was dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the year 2017, there have been rumors about Brad Pitt dating Kate Hudson, Sienna Miller, Charlize Theron, Alia Shawkat, and Andra Day among others. In some of those cases, those relationships have been denied they ever dated Pitt but still, it is amazing to see how many rumors about his love life there have been.</p><p>Most recently, in late 2022 there were rumors about Brad Pitt and Emily Ratajkowski dating. According to a "Hollywood insider" who spoke to Page Six, Pitt and Ratajkowski wasn't a full-fledged couple yet but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were getting very close</a>.</p><p>“People have been speculating about this for a while. Brad is not dating anybody. They [Pitt and Ratajkowski] have been seen a couple times together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the insider was clear that in recent months Brad Pitt has “been seen with other people”, they also said to "stay tuned" for potential news about him and Emily Ratajkowski becoming a couple.</p><p>A month before Page Six's report, OK! Magazine quoted an insider who claimed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitt asked Ratajkowski out</a> even though she only recently filed for divorce herself.</p><p>“He asked her out, and she said yes.

In the aftermath of that photo session, Ratajkowski made an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everyone Pete Davidson Dated Before Kim Kardashian</a></span></p><p>When the host Seth Meyers seemingly mocked the idea of Pete Davidson being a model, Emily Ratajkowski immediately stuck up for him. On top of that, Ratajkowski went on to explain <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why so many famous and gorgeous women have dated Davidson</a>.</p><p>“He’s got the height. Obviously women find him very attractive.” “Guys are like, ‘Wow, what’s that guy got.’ And I’m like, I mean, he seems super charming. He’s vulnerable. He’s lovely. His fingernail polish is awesome.

However, things aren't that simple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Emily Ratajkowski spoke about Pete Davidson on Late Night with Seth Meyers, her affection for what she knew about him as a person seemed really genuine. With that in mind, if Ratajkowski has opted to be with Brad Pitt solely because of how good-looking he is, Davidson may be a better partner for her.</p><p>At the end of the day, the only person who is in the position to decide who should be Emily Ratajkowski's partner is the model herself. Still, the fact that there is a solid argument that Pete Davidson would be a better partner for Ratajkowski than Brad Pitt is remarkable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpqGcrnqzrdOaoaSnp6i4qnnPnqueZZSWw6qw0qilZpyRqbavs4yrrKanopqxbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2auoqyYYq%2BzrcNmp6KspGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vixen-book-review-does-belle-brooklyn-live-hype-65389.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does A Belle In Brooklyn Live Up To The Hype?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./austin-butler-hannah-montana-zoey-101-cast-relationship-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Austin Butler Hookup With Any Of His Hannah Montana Or Zoey 101 Co-Stars?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
