They focus on being parents and raising their kids now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to their wealth and fame, they’re concerned about raising typical Hollywood kids that are entitled and spoiled. It might come as a shock but they’re known for being strict parents. They enforce strict rules that have even created a bit of controversy. Regardless, they feel they know what is best for their kids. They love them dearly but want them to grow up with strong values and morals. Here is a look at 15 Rules Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. Make Their Kids Follow.</p><h2 id=parenting-advice><strong>Parenting Advice</strong></h2><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar is heavily involved with several charitable organizations, such as, CARE, Project Angel Food, and Habitat for Humanity. Gellar is very outspoken about redefining gender norms. She also tries to teach her kids that men and women are equal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early 2018, She created controversy when she took her son to the nail salon. The mother and son enjoyed a day of pampering and got matching nails done. However, Gellar received a significant backlash from the Internet. Many people were unhappy with her decision to take her son and even called it “child abuse”. Gellar had a great deal of support as well as many of her fans stood up for her. Many of her fans praised her parenting skills and approach. However, she is no stranger to controversy and will not allow anyone to mommy-shame her for how she raises her kids. She ignores the Internet and the parenting advice they try to give. She said, “I give zero (expletives). Parenting is the hardest thing. If one of my friends called me and said something, maybe I’d feel that way. Freddie once told me that if you read your good reviews, you have to read your bad reviews just as much.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kids-need-limits><strong>Kids Need Limits</strong></h2><p>In the late 90’s and early 2000’s, Sarah Michelle Gellar was on the cover of every magazine and appeared on all the major talk shows. She found a great deal of success as a television actor but soon branched out. She became one of the biggest movie stars in the world. She appeared in several memorable films, such as Scream 2, Cruel Intentions and The Grudge. She now focuses on her family and other business ventures. She takes motherhood very seriously and doesn’t think there is one simple answer or the perfect parenting advice.</p><p><strong>She said, “I don't believe in ‘best’ and ‘worst’. Someone can give you any type of advice, and it's up to you how you utilize it.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USMagazine</a>)</strong></p><p>Both Freddie Prinze and Gellar are strict parents but in their own way. Prinze feels that his wife is much harder on their daughter. Gellar said, “Freddie sometimes says I’m harder on Charlotte because she’s a girl and sometimes I’ll say that I think he’s harder on Rocky. Maybe it’s because I know how difficult girls can be.” She added, “We’re both very strict. Kids need limits. I would feel mommy-shamed [only] if I raised a serial killer.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMailUK</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-wasting-food><strong>No Wasting Food</strong></h2><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze met while working on the film I Know What You Did Last Summer and its sequel.

However, when it comes to parenting they don’t worry about being sweet and adorable, especially since the kids got that covered. As noted, both Prinze and Gellar are serious about their healthy lifestyle. Many of their rules actually pertain to food and the kitchen. One of their most famous rules is there absolutely no wasting of food. Gellar said, “My daughter was doing this thing lately where she was asking me for a cup of milk and not drinking it. So I told her that every time she'd ask me for a cup of milk and not drink it, I would take a quarter out of her piggy bank. Someone has to pay for that milk.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WorkingMother</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=independent-kids><strong>Independent Kids</strong></h2><p>In 2014, Sarah Michelle Gellar co-founded the company Foodstirs. They sell baking and cooking kits that are kid-friendly. These kits contain non-GMO and organic ingredients. Gellar and her friends launched the company after going to a local grocery store and reading the ingredients. Gellar said, “I thought, I don’t want to feed my kids this! I’m a time-impoverished mom and I need labels that are easy to pronounce.” A parent at her children’s school, Galit Laibow, came up with the kits and showed it to Gellar and the other parents. The kits are easy to make and is completed in six steps. Foodstirs encourages children and parents to make the meals together. Foodstirs company motto is “Put down your phone, pick up a whisk!” In 2017, the company was listed on the CNBC Upstart 25.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gellar and Freddie Prinze stride to raise independent kids and try to set a good example. Gellar and Prinze share the parenting responsibilities. Gellar said, “(We) split everything pretty fairly. I mean, I think that that's how you have to raise children today, as you want them to be independent and want them to see in our society that there is no difference between men and women and go from there.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABCNews</a>)</p><h2 id=patience-is-power><b>Patience</b><strong> Is Power</strong></h2><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. have many strict rules their kids must follow. They’re both major Hollywood stars known all over the world but none of that matters when it comes to their kids. They make sure their kids have fun and enjoy their activities. They don’t just force them to do things they don’t like but make them take risks and try new things. They find different ways to teach their kids about eating healthy.</p><p><strong>Gellar said, “We have to be aware of not just what we put in our body but where it comes from and what it's doing to our planet.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delish</a>)</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They try to teach their kids about the food their eating while finding ways to make it fun. They’re strict parents but know the importance of having fun. They understand how difficult it can be for parents to get their kids to eat healthy. They not only try to raise kids with strict rules but also try to give guidance to other parents. Prinze said, “I wish good luck for those struggling. I see that look on my kids’ faces but patience is power. Kids can’t have it, but we can have it. We can win that battle. It’s just really, really hard.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ParentsCanada</a>)</p><h2 id=cooking-with-the-family><strong>Cooking With The Family</strong></h2><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. have been together for roughly 18 years. They made headlines all over the world when they married in 2002. They met in 1997 on the set of the famous horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer.

It’s important to them to stay connected as a family and their favourite family activity is to cook in the kitchen. Gellar said, “Cooking and eating is the one time to connect with your family. Life slows down and it's about the people.” She has always enjoyed having her kids in the kitchen and takes the opportunity to teach them. She added, “Making food is a jumping-off point to connect, and I can get my kids involved. I've always had my kids in the kitchen — I'll tell Charlotte, ‘I need three cups of this’ and she'll pour and dump, and when my son was younger he would point to the numbers.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USMagazine</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-pressure><strong>No Pressure</strong></h2><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. both started their careers at very young ages. Gellar landed her first role at the age of four after being discovered at a restaurant. She later appeared in several commercials and mini-series. Prinze started acting when he was older landing his first role in 1995. They both went on to achieve international fame and success. Many children with famous parents often follow in their footsteps or at least attempt too.</p><p>However, Gellar and Prinze are different than most Hollywood couples. They won’t pressure their kids to enter showbiz like them. They’d prefer that their children pick their own path in life and will support them no matter what.</p><p><strong>Gellar said, “I think there’s a very different pressure for ‘the children of’ … They can decide what they want to do for themselves. I’ll never push them.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gellar realizes that her kids are having a vastly different upbringing than hers. She said, “It’s different because I wasn’t the child of someone that was in the public eye, and so, unfortunately, I think the rules are different.” Gellar also noted that her kids are focusing on school and don’t seem eager to jump on stage. She also said, “But, in the meantime, they have to stick to schooling. My kids have too much stage fright anyway.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>)</p><h2 id=no-money-for-chores><strong>No Money For Chores</strong></h2><p>Doing chores around the house are crucial in all households. In most cases, the last thing a kid wants to do is a chore. However, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. are strong believers in doing chores and not getting paid for it. Prinze’s family has been in the industry for years. He's the son of comedic actor Freddie Prinze Sr. Freddie Prinze Sr. is best known for portraying Chico in the 70’s sitcom Chico and the Man. Prinze followed his father into the industry and became one of the most recognizable names in Hollywood.

It’s his main priority even when he gets back to work. Gellar and Prinze are known for having strict rules for their kids. The kids must do their chores and don’t get an allowance for it. Gellar and Prinze believe that doing chores are just a part of being a family member. Gellar said, “I don't love the idea of giving them money to do chores that they should do anyway.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>)</p><h2 id=no-phones-in-the-kitchen><strong>No Phones In The Kitchen</strong></h2><p>In the early 90’s, Sarah Michelle Gellar had her first big break and quickly became a teen sensation. In 1993, she began to portray Kendall Hart in the ABC soap All My Children. In 1995, she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now she focuses on her family and healthy lifestyle. She's known for loving to cook and eating healthy. She encourages her kids and others to eat healthily and to get in the kitchen. Additionally, she released a cookbook, Stirring up Fun with Food. Cooking and focusing on her family has taken precedence over her career. She loves to spend time with her kids in the kitchen. She finds that cooking together is a way to make the family more connected. Most kids nowadays spend a great deal of time on their phones or other devices. She said, “We all live in such a tech-heavy world, and it's important to take it back to a simple time.” Gellar and Prinze have a strict, no devices&nbsp;on the kitchen rule. She said, “It’s about the time that we spend together, it’s about no phones in the kitchen.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delish</a>) She loves to get in the kitchen with her kids and takes the opportunity to teach them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=successful-marriage><strong>Successful Marriage</strong></h2><p>This isn’t a rule for the kids but more about the parents. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. find that having a strong marriage leads to good parenting. Prinze said, “We were just friends. That's one of the reasons I think our relationship has always been so good.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!News</a>) They share the parenting responsibilities and the cooking in the kitchen. They still put in a&nbsp;great deal of effort into the marriage. Gellar said,</p><p><strong>“It evolves daily, and anyone that tells you that relationships aren’t work isn’t in a real one — and that goes for married couples, friends, family. It takes work. We think we’re so connected now because of these different devices, but ultimately we’re becoming more and more disconnected.”</strong></p><p>Gellar revealed the secret to her nearly 20 years of marriage. She said, “Separate bathrooms. I feel like there are certain things that should just be kept your own and they never need to know.” The philosophy applies to other aspects of life. She added, “Also, maybe, possibly, a separate shopping credit card or if you are a guy, maybe a separate gaming card so I don’t have to see how much video games cost.” However, she also has much simpler advice. She said, “It’s about putting that effort in.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=life-lessons-in-the-kitchen><strong>Life Lessons In The Kitchen</strong></h2><p>As noted, Sarah Michelle Gellar is very outspoken on a healthy lifestyle and raising her kids with strict rules. However, she isn’t the only health conscious writer in the family. In fact, Freddie Prinze Jr. is equally passionate about food and spending time with the family. Additionally, Prinze went to culinary school and is often cooking.</p><p><strong>Gellar said, “I love his pulled pork, and his Brussels sprouts are really good. And he does this pasta that's one of my favourites!” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delish</a>)</strong></p><p>In 2017, Prinze released the cookbook, Back to the Kitchen. Gellar admits that the key to getting the kids in the kitchen is patience and understanding. Also, they’ve learned that baking is the easiest way to get the kids cooking. Gellar said, “Baking is about quality time, and it's a lot easier to motivate kids to make cupcakes than chicken. It requires patience, time, and it's about making memories.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USMagazine</a>) The time spent in the kitchen is not only about learning to cook but also connecting with each other. Prinze learned some of the most valuable lessons in the kitchen as a child. He said, “I grew up with a mother who was amazing in the kitchen, and a ton of the life lessons that I learned were in front of a stove.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ParentsCanada</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=including-kids-in-the-process><strong>Including Kids In The Process</strong></h2><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. tied the knot on September 1, 2002, in Mexico. They have two children, Charlotte, born in 2009 and Rocky, born in 2012. Some Hollywood parents are known for focusing on themselves even after having children. Some stars can’t give up the spotlight not even for their family. Gellar and Prinze have been able to balance their careers and family life. They’re clearly focused on raising their kids to grow up to be good people. They start by enforcing strict rules and taking the opportunity to include the kids in the process.</p><p>The kids have many chores and most of them revolve around the kitchen. Gellar said, “I’m not a restaurant. I believe in including my kids in the process. We went to the farmer’s market and they get to pick vegetables they eat over the weekend. I give them a list at the supermarket and ask them to get something.” They teach them reasonability and the value of hard work. Gellar said, “I do a lot of cooking with the kids. I’m big on child labor.” She added, “The kids have to help with the mashed potatoes. You want them to understand what the process is. Everything doesn’t come from a box in your house.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cleaning-up><strong>Cleaning Up</strong></h2><p>Getting kids to join in on the cooking and enjoy it can be difficult. It can also be difficult to get them to do the one thing that is worse than having to cook. The post-cooking clean up is one of the chores kids despise the most. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar don’t only use cooking to spend time with the family but it’s a good way to get the kids to open up. Prinze said, “When they’re distracted and cracking eggs and focused, they don’t know you’re trying to milk them for information. That’s one of my tricks to get them to talk.”</p><p><strong>In his cookbook, he pushed the idea that making a mess isn’t a bad thing. He said, “You shouldn’t be afraid to get messy when you’re cooking.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, he calls the recipes in his cookbook “Messipes”. The kids always have to help with cleaning up as well. He said, “With my son, it’s easy. It’s a squirt bottle I put Palmolive dish soap and water in. If he sees a stain, he squirts it and I wipe it.” However, cleaning up with his daughter is a bit easier. He added, “Clean-up is easy with my daughter because she is caring and creative. I ask her to do it, and she does it.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ParentsCanada</a>)</p><h2 id=rule-for-picky-eaters><strong>Rule For Picky Eaters</strong></h2><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar became a household name after portraying Buffy Summers in the immensely popular series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

She sometimes has to deal with picky eaters in her family and luckily she doesn’t deal with them like she did the vampires. Gellar and Prinze have a strict rule when it comes to eating new food. Gellar said, “We have a rule in our house. You have to try something 10 times and two times more before you decide whether or not you like it.” Their kids might not like the rule now but when they get older they’ll appreciate the health benefits of it. Gellar uses cooking as way to connect with her kids and to teach them. She said, “I learned quickly that to get my kids to be adventurous in their choices, I had to involve them in the process of preparing food.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delish</a>)</p><h2 id=food-crafting><strong>Food Crafting</strong></h2><p>Food has always been a crucial part of Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze’s relationship. Prinze had dated a few Hollywood stars but he didn’t like any of them. He said, “A lot of girls back then in Hollywood as far as the actresses, they didn't eat, they ate salad.” On their first date, Gellar couldn’t hide her love for food but it only made Prinze fall in love with her. He added,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“So Sarah came to dinner with me, and we sat down and she ate everything, including a crab that they let walk across the counter, then kill while it was alive in some oil and said, ‘It's popcorn, try!’ And she ate it without even blinking, and I was like, ‘Yo, my girl is legit.’” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!News</a>)</strong></p><p>Food continues to play a huge role in the family. In her cookbook, Stirring up Fun with Food, Gellar discusses a technique she calls “food crafting”.
