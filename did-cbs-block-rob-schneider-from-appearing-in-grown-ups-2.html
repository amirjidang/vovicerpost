The argument was also made that he played the bad guy so often in movies, that people (including casting directors) started to view him in a similar manner in real life.</p><p>One person who clearly had no problem working with Schneider is Adam Sandler. The pair <a href=#>appeared together in multiple films</a> over the years. Among others, the list of their collaborative big screen projects include Big Daddy, The Hot Chicks, 50 First Dates and You Don’t Mess With The Zohan.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Rob Schneider's Relationship With His Daughter Elle King</a></span></p><p>Schneider and Sandler were also part of the ensemble cast in the latter’s comedy flick Grown Ups in 2010. Although the film was panned by critics, it was so commercially successful that it earned a sequel. Unfortunately for Schneider, he was not to be part of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-character-did-rob-schneider-play-in-grown-ups>What Character Did Rob Schneider Play In Grown Ups?</h2><p>Grown Ups is the story of “Five life-long friends, [who] assemble once more in their hometown for the funeral of their beloved [high school basketball] coach, Bobby “The Buzzer.”</p><p>“Intent on spending the July 4th weekend with their families and catch up with the old buddies, the team of Lenny, [a] successful talent agent; Eric, [a] furniture company co-owner; Kurt, [a] stay-at-home-dad; Rob, [a] man with a history of divorces, and Marcus, the womanizer, rent an isolated lake house to continue where they left off.

The series was created by Schneider and Lew Morton, both of whom had previously worked on <a href=#><strong>Saturday Night Live</strong></a>.</p><p>Rob followed Rob Schneider as a fictionalized version of himself. In the story, he is depicted as “a former lifelong bachelor and landscape architect with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, who marries into a tight-knit Mexican American family and attempts to be closer to them, often ending in disastrous results despite his good intentions.”</p><p>Schneider’s co-stars in Rob were Claudia Bassols as his wife Maggie, Cheech Marin and Diana-Maria Riva as Maggie’s parents Fernando and Rosa, Eugenio Derbez as her uncle Hector, and Lupe Ontiveros as Abuelita, her grandmother.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>David Spade And Rob Schneider Host Unique Drive-In Comedy Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rob premiered on CBS in January 2012, and ran for eight episodes until March.

In fact, he is said to have written the various roles with the specific actors in mind to begin with. It was a bit of a surprise therefore, when Rob Schneider failed to return for the sequel.</p><p>This was even more so the case when it became apparent that the actor himself had <a href=#>turned down the opportunity to appear in Grown Ups 2</a>. In justifying his reasoning for the decision, Schneider referred to a scheduling conflict between the film and Rob on CBS. At the same time, he also implied that he wasn’t offered a financial package that he deemed worth accepting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They’re doing Grown Ups 2 without me.
