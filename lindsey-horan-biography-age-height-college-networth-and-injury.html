Instead, she played club soccer with the Colorado Rush. She first started playing for the Rush* during the U-11 tryouts. In March, when Horan was 15 years old and was one of the youngest players on the United States under-17 women’s national team, she scored 12 goals in nine games (a team best) leading up to the North American/Central American/Caribbean U-17 tournament in Costa Rica. During her sophomore year at Golden, she was named to the Parade Magazine High School All-American team although she didn’t play high school soccer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lindsey-horan-career></span><span><strong>Lindsey Horan Career</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She played for the Colorado Rush in the W-League during the 2012 season. She played three games for the team, scoring two goals and taking 19 shots.</p><p>In July 2012, Horan signed a six-figure deal to play with the professional French club, Paris Saint-Germain FC (PSG). On January 4, 2016, Paris Saint-Germain announced Horan’s contract had been terminated to allow her to return to the United States. Horan played her final game on December 5, 2015, a 5–0 win over FCF Juvisy. Horan scored the match’s opening goal. Horan scored 46 goals in 58 appearances for PSG.<br>Horan signed with the Portland Thorns FC of the NWSL On January 13, 2016.</p><p>Unlike her role at PSG, Horan for Portland plays in central midfield in a position similar to her national-team role.[original research</p><p>Horan scored the only goal in Portland’s 1–0 win over the North Carolina Courage in the 2017 NWSL Championship and was named NWSL Championship MVP.</p><p>Horan was named Player of the Month for July 2018, she scored three goals in July, helping the Thorns to a 3–0–0 record for the month. She was named to the 2018 NWSL Best XI, and on September 21, 2018 she was named 2018 NWSL Most Valuable Player.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lindsey-horan-international-career></span><span><strong>Lindsey Horan International Career</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She played for the United States women’s national under-17 soccer team and was the leading scorer for the team at the 2010 CONCACAF Under-17 Women’s Championship. She helped the United States women’s national under-20 soccer team win the 2012 CONCACAF Women’s U-20 Championship in March by scoring four goals, including a hat trick against Guatemala in the group stage. Horan was unable to play in the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup because of a knee injury that required surgery.</p><p>In February 2013, at the age of eighteen, she was named to the senior team roster for the 2013 Algarve Cup. Horan earned her first cap for the senior team during a group stage match against China at the Algarve on March 8, 2013. Horan was called up to the senior roster near the end of 2015 and scored her first goal for the senior team during a ‘Woman of the Match’ performance against Trinidad & Tobago in December 2015. She is on the roster for the 2016 CONCACAF Women’s Olympic Qualifying Championship and started the opening group stage match against Costa Rica in central midfield.</p><p>While Horan played successfully as a striker during her time at PSG, with 46 goals in 56 appearances, she gained praise for her role in central midfield after her return to the national team in 2016.</p><p>Horan was called up for the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, scoring her first World Cup goal in the opening game against Thailand on 11 June.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lindsey-horan-salary></span><span><strong>Lindsey Horan Salary</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2012, Lindsey signed up with PSG for a 6 figure contract. Despite her move back to the US where there’s a cap on female soccer players’ earnings, we still like to assume that she earns a good pay. Recall that she is the NWSL Most Valuable Player for 2018.</p><p>As regards the striker cum midfielder’s Salary, there is no official release yet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lindsey-horan-networth></span><span><strong>Lindsey Horan Networth</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her Exact Networth Is still Under Investigation we Will Update when Information is Available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lindsey-horan-injury></span><span><strong>Lindsey Horan Injury</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lindsey Horan stepped onto the field for a training session with the Portland Thorns Tuesday afternoon. It was her first practice since suffering a quadriceps injury more than a month ago. While she was limited in what she could do on the field, Horan was elated to be back on the pitch.</p><p>“I’m a lot better,” Horan said. “I’m progressing. Obviously, it’s a frustrating little injury, but I’m four or five weeks out (from when I sustained the injury) and I’m doing really well. I was back on the field yesterday and today, which was exciting.”</p><p>The U.S. Women’s National Team announced in early February that Horan would miss the SheBelieves Cup in March due to injury. It was a major blow for the 24-year-old, who is gearing up for her first World Cup this summer.</p><p>Horan was forced to watch from afar as the USA finished second in the SheBelieves Cup this week. The tournament was seen a disappointment for the United States, who are the defending Women’s World Cup champions and are favored to win the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France this summer.</p><p>“To be perfectly honest, it sucked,” said Horan about watching the national team compete from afar. “It’s very hard to watch your team and not be there, but it’s also cool in a different way. You get to watch them from a different perspective and you see everything and you get to analyze the game… I thought we were so great on so many levels and then there were, obviously, a lot of mistakes that happened and some defensive errors. I personally think this is the time to have those errors and we got to learn from them.”</p><p>Due to her injury, Horan returned to Portland earlier than the rest of the Thorns’ national team players to rejoin the club when it opened preseason training camp.</p><p>While Horan took a big step forward by jumping into limited training this week, she said she was still unsure about her timeline to return to play. Horan said she is hopeful that she will be healthy enough to feature in some of Portland’s preseason games at the end of March and represent the national team when it takes on Australia in Colorado, Horan’s home state, on April 4.</p><p>Horan is coming off a huge year with the Thorns in the NWSL. She won the 2018 NWSL MVP Award after finishing third in the league with 13 goals and adding two assists in 22 starts and helping to lead the Thorns to the NWSL Championship Game. She also led the league in touches (1,852), duels won (297), aerial duels won (141) and successful passes in the opponent’s half (493). She hopes to build on that performance and help the club claim a trophy this season.</p><p>But Horan’s priority this year has to be the World Cup.</p><p>Horan and the rest of Portland’s national team players will miss a significant portion of the NWSL season to compete in the World Cup this summer. The Thorns are set to lose at least nine players to the tournament. It is still unclear how many NWSL games those players will miss.<br>“It’s frustrating,” Horan said. “I love playing for the Thorns. Given our schedules, it’s hard. Obviously, the World Cup is the biggest thing in soccer and that’s what you want to play for and that’s what we’re here to do, but it is unfortunate that we miss so many games.”</p><p>U.S. Women’s National Team coach Jill Ellis has yet to name her World Cup roster, but Horan is all but assured a spot on the team.</p><p>Prior to her injury, Horan, who has 62 caps with the national team, was earning consistent starts in the midfield and appeared poised to play a big role in France this summer. While Horan is taking nothing for granted, she is expected to regain that starting spot once she returns to full health in the coming weeks.</p><p>But Horan is also enjoying her time in Portland at the moment. She said that it will be important that everyone is on the same page in preseason and that the Thorns feel prepared to deal with the absences of their international players this season.</p><p>Horan not only hopes to raise a World Cup trophy with the United States in France this summer, but she wants to return to Portland after the tournament and help the Thorns reclaim the NWSL Championship trophy that they won in 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fobavsNKesGagn6eur3nBoqagqpGltbp5wKCcZqCVnrSpwIycpqWklZyybrrEra6oqqSdeqK6w2agp6Klp8Zw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-deena-hinshaw-biography-education-age-wiki-net-worth-twitter-husband.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Deena Hinshaw Biography: Education, Age, Wiki, Net Worth, Twitter, Husband</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./laz-alonso-bio-wiki-age-height-girlfriend-net-worth-and-the-boys.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Laz Alonso Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth and The Boys</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./zeke-on-wizards-of-waverly-place-memba-him.html>Zeke on 'Wizards Of Waverly Place' 'Memba Him?!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./expensive-and-high-maintenance-pets.html>Expensive and High Maintenance Pets</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-celebs-who-you-didnt-know-had-strange-body-parts.html>15 Celebs Who You Didn't Know Had Strange Body Parts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-hall-reacts-to-tyler-stanaland-leaving-the-oppenheim-group.html>Alex Hall Reacts to Tyler Stanaland Leaving the Oppenheim Group</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-wayne-hughes-net-worth.html>B Wayne Hughes Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog.
